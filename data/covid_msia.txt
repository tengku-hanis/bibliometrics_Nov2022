AB Malaysia reported its first COVID-19 case on January 25, 2020, and the
   cases have continued to grow, necessitating the implementation of
   additional measures. Hence, determining the factors responsible for the
   significant increase in COVID-19 cases is the top priority issue for the
   government to take necessary action and ultimately restrain this virus
   before the vaccine availability. Researchers had predicted that air
   pollution had an indirect relationship with COVID-19 in terms of virus
   infections. As a result, this study focuses on the link between the Air
   Pollutant Index (API) and COVID-19 infections. The initial data set
   consists of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Malaysia and API readings
   obtained from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Department of the
   Environment (DOE). The results show that Klang (S22) recorded the
   highest mean of API which at 62.70 while the lowest is at Limbang (S37)
   (25.37). Next, due to the implementation of Movement Control Order (MCO)
   in Malaysia and reducing social movement, 27 stations recorded a good
   level of API compare to the stations that recorded moderate and
   unhealthy levels. There is positive relationship between API and
   COVID-19 at each of the region which are North 0.4% (R-2= 0.004),
   Central 2.1% (R-2= 0.021), South 0.04% (R-2= 0.0004), East 1.6% (R-2=
   0.016), Sarawak 0.2% (R-2= 0.002), meanwhile Sabah recorded negative
   correlation at 4.3% (R-2= 0.043). To conclude, the API value did not
   have a strong relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 daily
   cases.

AB Introduction: Information on the clinical characteristics of local
   patients with confirmed COVID-19 is limited. This study aims to report
   the clinical characteristics of 147 patients admitted and receiving
   treatment at a teaching hospital. Methodology: Patients'
   socio-demographic and epidemiological data, clinical features,
   laboratory findings and clinical outcomes were extracted using a data
   sheet. Results: The median patient age was 25 [interquartile range
   (IQR)] 20-44) years, and most of patients were male (68.7%) and of
   Malaysian nationality (88.4%). Almost half of the patients were from a
   case cluster related to a religious event (48.3%) and 12.9% had a
   history of overseas travel. A total of 33.3% of patients were not
   related to any case cluster, i.e. sporadic cases. Radiological
   investigation showed that 13.6% of the patients had chest X-ray changes
   and all laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges. Sixty-six
   patients (44.9%) experienced symptoms. The most common symptoms were
   rhinitis (66.7%), followed by fever (19.7%) and cough (15.2%). Age,
   gender, case cluster, comorbidity status, haemoglobin, albumin, total
   protein, bilirubin total and alkaline phosphatase level were associated
   with symptomatic status. Conclusions: In this single-centre study,
   COVID-19 infection led not only to case clusters, but also to sporadic
   infections, with patients being either symptomatic or asymptomatic.
   These sporadic cases and asymptomatic patients may hamper effective
   contact tracing, leading to rapid human-to-human transmission in our
   population. Future studies on the prevalence and clinical significance
   of asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 patients would pre-emptively
   address issues on further containment of the pandemic.

AB Background: Asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
   (SARS-CoV-2) infections are well documented. Healthcare workers (HCW)
   are at increased risk of infection due to occupational exposure to
   infected patients. We aim to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
   antibodies among HCW who did not come to medical attention.
   Methods: We prospectively recruited 400 HCW from the National Public
   Health Laboratory and two COVID-19 designated public hospitals in Klang
   Valley, Malaysia between 13/4/2020 and 12/5/2020. Quota sampling was
   used to ensure representativeness of HCW involved in direct and indirect
   patient care. All participants answered a self-administered
   questionnaire and blood samples were taken to test for SARS-CoV-2
   antibodies by surrogate virus neutralization test.
   Findings: The study population comprised 154 (38.5%) nurses, 103 (25.8%)
   medical doctors, 47 (11.8%) laboratory technologists and others (23.9%).
   A majority (68.9%) reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the past month
   within their respective workplaces. Adherence to personal protection
   equipment (PPE) guidelines and hand hygiene were good, ranging from
   91-100% compliance. None (95% CI: 0, 0.0095) of the participants had
   SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected, despite 182 (45.5%) reporting some
   symptoms one month prior to study recruitment. One hundred and fifteen
   (29%) of participants claimed to have had contact with known COVID-19
   persons outside of their workplace.
   Interpretation: Zero seroprevalence among HCW suggests a low incidence
   of undiagnosed COVID-19 infection in our healthcare setting during the
   first local wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The occupational risk of
   SARS-CoV-2 transmission within healthcare facilities can be prevented by
   adherence to infection control measures and appropriate use of PPE. (C)

AB More than 1.75 million COVID-19 infections and 16 thousand associated
   deaths have been reported in Malaysia. A meta-analysis on the prevalence
   of COVID-19 in different clinical stages before the National COVID-19
   Vaccination Program in Malaysia is still lacking. To address this, the
   disease severity of a total of 215 admitted COVID-19 patients was
   initially recorded in the early phase of this study, and the data were
   later pooled into a meta-analysis with the aim of providing insight into
   the prevalence of COVID-19 in 5 different clinical stages during the
   outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. We have conducted a
   systematic literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus,
   ScienceDirect, and two preprint databases (bioRxiv and medRxiv) for
   relevant studies with specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
   quality assessment for the included studies was performed using the
   Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The heterogeneity was examined with an I2 index
   and a Q-test. Funnel plots and Egger's tests were performed to determine
   publication bias in this meta-analysis. Overall, 5 studies with 6375
   patients were included, and the pooled prevalence rates in this
   meta-analysis were calculated using a random-effect model. The highest
   prevalence of COVID-19 in Malaysia was observed in Stage 2 cases
   (32.0%), followed by Stage 1 (27.8%), Stage 3 (17.1%), Stage 4 (7.6%),
   and Stage 5 (3.4%). About two-thirds of the number of cases have at
   least one morbidity, with the highest percentage of hypertension
   (66.7%), obesity (55.5%), or diabetes mellitus (33.3%) in Stage 5
   patients. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested a high prevalence
   of COVID-19 occurred in Stage 2. The prevalence rate in Stage 5 appeared
   to be the lowest among COVID-19 patients before implementing the
   vaccination program in Malaysia. These meta-analysis data are critically
   useful for designing screening and vaccination programs and improving
   disease management in the country.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic first emerged in Malaysia in Jan 2020. As of 12th
   Sept 2021, 1,979,698 COVID-19 cases that occurred over three major
   epidemic waves were confirmed. The virus contributing to the three
   epidemic waves has not been well-studied. We sequenced the genome of 22
   SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in Malaysia during the second and the
   ongoing third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Detailed phylogenetic and
   genetic variation analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate genomes were
   performed using these newly determined sequences and all other available
   sequences. Results from the analyses suggested multiple independent
   introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Malaysia. A new B.1.524(G) lineage with
   S-D614G mutation was detected in Sabah, East Malaysia and Selangor,
   Peninsular Malaysia on 7th October 2020 and 14th October 2020,
   respectively. This new B.1.524(G) group was not the direct descendant of
   any of the previously detected lineages. The new B.1.524(G) carried a
   set of genetic variations, including A701V (position variant frequency =
   0.0007) in Spike protein and a novel G114T mutation at the 5'UTR. The
   biological importance of the specific mutations remained unknown. The
   sequential appearance of the mutations, however, suggests that the
   spread of the new B.1.524(G) lineages likely begun in Sabah and then
   spread to Selangor. The findings presented here support the importance
   of SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequencing as a tool to establish an
   epidemiological link between cases or clusters of COVID-19 worldwide.

AB Malaysia has experienced three waves of coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) as of March 31, 2021. We studied the associated molecular
   epidemiology and SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during the third wave. We
   obtained 60 whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences between October 2020 and
   January 2021 in Kuala Lumpur/Selangor and analyzed 989 available
   Malaysian sequences. We tested 653 residual serum samples collected
   between December 2020 to April 2021 for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total
   antibodies, as a proxy for population immunity. The first wave (January
   2020) comprised sporadic imported cases from China of early Pango
   lineages A and B. The second wave (March-June 2020) was associated with
   lineage B.6. The ongoing third wave (from September 2020) was propagated
   by a state election in Sabah. It is due to lineage B.1.524 viruses
   containing spike mutations D614G and A701V. Lineages B.1.459, B.1.470,
   and B.1.466.2 were likely imported from the region and confined to
   Sarawak state. Direct age-standardized seroprevalence in Kuala
   Lumpur/Selangor was 3.0%. The second and third waves were driven by
   super-spreading events and different circulating lineages. Malaysia is
   highly susceptible to further waves, especially as alpha (B.1.1.7) and
   beta (B.1.351) variants of concern were first detected in December
   2020/January 2021. Increased genomic surveillance is critical.

AB An outbreak of respiratory illness which is proven to be infected by a
   2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) officially named as Coronavirus
   Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China and has
   spread rapidly in other parts of China as well as other countries around
   the world, including Malaysia. The first case in Malaysia was identified
   on 25 January 2020 and the number of cases continue to rise since March
   2020. Therefore, 2020 Malaysia Movement Control Order (MCO) was
   implemented with the aim to isolate the source of the COVID-19 outbreak.
   As a result, there were fewer number of motor vehicles on the road and
   the operation of industries was suspended, ergo reducing emissions of
   hazardous air pollutants in the atmosphere. We had acquired the Air
   Pollutant Index (API) data fromthe Department of Environment Malaysia on
   hourly basis before and during the MCO with the aim to track the changes
   of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 68 air quality monitoring
   stations. It was found that the PM2.5 concentrations showed a high
   reduction of up to 58.4% during the MCO. Several red zone areas (>41
   confirmed COVID-19 cases) had also reduced of up to 28.3% in the PM2.5
   concentrations variation. The reduction did not solely depend on MCO,
   thus the researchers suggest a further study considering the influencing
   factors that need to be adhered to in the future. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Malaysia has been relatively successful in managing the COVID-19
   pandemic, with the number of deaths and infections lower than
   neighboring countries and many developed economies. This paper will
   share Malaysia's experience in fighting the pandemic, particularly the
   key success factors in managing the health impact during the period of
   January to August 2020. The speedy preparation and planning by the
   Health Ministry even before the country registered its first case was
   instrumental in ensuring that the country was ready to face the
   pandemic. Lessons learned from previous experience with epidemics such
   as Nipah, SARS, MERS, and H1N1 were also key to the speedy responses.
   Effective communication helped to ensure the public's support of
   measures imposed by the government to reduce the spread of the virus.
   However, while the country managed the health crisis relatively well,
   the handling of the economy is rather poor, with the economic impact
   being much worse than what was experienced during the 1997-98 Asian
   financial crisis, and the 2008-09 global financial crisis. This paper
   will end with suggestions of several policy interventions to mitigate
   the economic impact of COVID-19, particularly for vulnerable groups.

AB Objective: This is a brief report of 4 paediatric cases of COVID-19
   infection in Malaysia
   Background: COVID-19, a coronavirus, first detected in Wuhan, China has
   now spread rapidly to over 60 countries and territories around the
   world, infecting more than 85000 individuals. As the case count amongst
   children is low, there is need to report COVID-19 in children to better
   understand the virus and the disease.
   Cases: In Malaysia, until end of February 2020, there were four COVID-19
   paediatric cases with ages ranging from 20 months to 11 years. All four
   cases were likely to have contracted the virus in China. The children
   had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness. The cases were managed
   symptomatically. None required antiviral therapy.
   Discussion: There were 2 major issues regarding the care of infected
   children. Firstly, the quarantine of an infected child with a parent who
   tested negative was an ethical dilemma. Secondly, oropharyngeal and
   nasal swabs in children were at risk of false negative results. These
   issues have implications for infection control. Consequently, there is a
   need for clearer guidelines for child quarantine and testing methods in
   the management of COVID-19 in children. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Background: COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the globe. Critical to
   the control of COVID-19 is the characterisation of its epidemiology.
   Despite this, there has been a paucity of evidence from many parts of
   the world, including Malaysia. We aim to describe the epidemiology of
   COVID-19 in Malaysia to inform prevention and control policies better.
   Methods: Malaysian COVID-19 data was extracted from 16 March 2020 up to
   31 May 2021. We estimated the following epidemiological indicators:
   7-day incidence rates, 7-day mortality rates, case fatality rates, test
   positive ratios, testing rates and the time-varying reproduction number
   (Rt).
   Findings: Between 16 March 2020 and 31 May 2021, Malaysia has reported
   571,901 cases and 2,796 deaths. Malaysia's average 7-day incidence rate
   was 26.6 reported infections per 100,000 population (95% CI: 17.8,
   38.1). The average test positive ratio and testing rate were 4.3% (95%
   CI: 1.6, 10.2) and 0.8 tests per 1,000 population (95% CI: <0.1, 3.7),
   respectively. The case fatality rates (CFR) was 0.6% (95% CI: <0.1,
   3.7). Among the 2,796 cases who died, 87.3% were >= 50 years.
   Interpretation: The public health response was successful in the
   suppression of COVID-19 transmission or the first half of 2020. However,
   a state election and outbreaks in institutionalised populations have
   been the catalyst for more significant community propagation. This
   rising community transmission has continued in 2021, leading to
   increased incidence and strained healthcare systems. Calibrating NPI
   based on epidemiological indicators remain critical for us to live with
   the virus. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study aimed to highlight the COVID-19 response by the Ministry of
   Health (MOH) and the Government of Malaysia in order to share Malaysia's
   lessons and to improve future pandemic preparedness. The team conducted
   a rapid review using publicly available information from MOH, PubMed,
   and World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Research on Coronavirus
   Disease Database to compile Malaysia's responses during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Measures taken between 31 December 2019 and 3 June 2020 were
   classified into domains as well as the pillars described in the WHO
   COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (WHO SPRP). Malaysia's
   response incorporated all pillars in the WHO SPRP and consisted of five
   domains, (i) whole-of-government, (ii) cordon sanitaire/lockdown, (iii)
   equity of access to services and supports, (iv) quarantine and isolation
   systems, and (v) legislation and enforcement. Some crucial measures
   taken were activation of a centralised multi-ministerial coordination
   council where MOH acted as an advisor, with collaboration from
   non-government organisations and private sectors which enabled an
   effective targeted screening approach, provision of subsidised COVID-19
   treatment and screening, isolation or quarantine of all confirmed cases,
   close contacts and persons under investigation, with all strategies
   applied irrespective of citizenship. This was provided for by way of the
   Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988. A combination of
   these measures enabled the nation to contain the COVID-19 outbreak by
   the end of June 2020.

AB With many countries experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, it is
   important to forecast disease trends to enable effective planning and
   implementation of control measures. This study aims to develop Seasonal
   Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models using 593 data
   points and smoothened case and covariate time-series data to generate a
   28-day forecast of COVID-19 case trends during the third wave in
   Malaysia. SARIMA models were developed using COVID-19 case data sourced
   from the Ministry of Health Malaysia's official website. Model training
   and validation was conducted from 22 January 2020 to 5 September 2021
   using daily COVID-19 case data. The SARIMA model with the lowest root
   mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAE) and
   Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was selected to generate forecasts
   from 6 September to 3 October 2021. The best SARIMA model with a RMSE =
   73.374, MAE = 39.716 and BIC = 8.656 showed a downward trend of COVID-19
   cases during the forecast period, wherein the observed daily cases were
   within the forecast range. The majority (89%) of the difference between
   the forecasted and observed values was well within a deviation range of
   25%. Based on this work, we conclude that SARIMA models developed in
   this paper using 593 data points and smoothened data and sensitive
   covariates can generate accurate forecast of COVID-19 case trends.

AB The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel behaviour is currently
   devastating the tourism sector. In this paper, we investigate the
   influence of destination image, COVID-19 risk knowledge, destination
   value and tourist intention to revisit. Empirical data were collected
   using an online survey distributed via social media platforms (Facebook,
   WhatsApp) and email. Our sample consisted of Malaysians who travelled
   several times during the movement control order periods (after February
   2020) in Malaysia. The results of structural equation modelling reveal
   that destination value significantly mediates the relationship between
   both components of destination image and tourist intention to revisit.
   Most importantly, we probed the interaction effect of COVID-19 risk
   knowledge on affective destination image. The results indicate that even
   a moderate level of understanding and knowledge of COVID-19 risks
   significantly strengthens the influence of affective destination image
   on destination value.

   through the application of control charts. This study also attempts to
   propose the target number of daily new cases that would bring the
   pandemic situation in Malaysia under control by utilizing the confirmed
   daily cases in Malaysia starting from 8(th) September 2020 until 30(th)
   June 2021. A modified Shewhart control chart was adopted to monitor the
   variations before and after the commencement of National Immunisation
   Programme (NIP). The chart shows a declining trend in the number of
   cases after the rollout of NIP whereby several days were brought to a
   state of statistical-in-control. But in less than three months after NIP
   commencement, there were huge variations in COVID-19 cases leading to
   drastic increase in the mean number of cases. These signal the presence
   of unnatural or assignable causes of variations which could be
   attributed to failure of curbing the risks of transmission, existence of
   various variants in the community, easing of containment measures and
   less adherence to the COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
   Significant shifts in the mean values prompt the development of a
   3-phase modified Shewhart control chart. From the 3-phase chart, a
   series of daily number new cases that can be set as the target value to
   bring the pandemic situation in Malaysia under control, while flattening
   the epidemiological curve in the very near term.

   the existing policy and legislation of CWM detailed in the Schedule
   Waste Regulation (2005), Environmental Quality Act, 1974, and with the
   standard operating procedure provided by the Ministry of Health,
   Malaysia. The case study conducted through survey and questionnaire

AB Introduction: Using steroids to manage hospitalised coronavirus disease
   2019 (COVID-19) patients caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection has been shown to reduce the need
   for mechanical ventilation and mortality. To date, lowdose dexamethasone
   and methylprednisolone corticosteroids have been effective in reducing
   the infection's progress in hospitalised patients. However, it is
   unknown if high dosages of corticosteroids can achieve a better clinical
   outcome. This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of
   hospitalised COVID-19 patients who are given a 10-day low-dose
   corticosteroid treatment (IV 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone loading dose
   (LD) then 0.25 mg/kg four times a day (q.i.d.)) with patients given a
   10-day high-dose corticosteroid treatment (IV 20 mg dexamethasone once
   daily (o.d.) or a 1.5 mg/kg prednisolone tablet o.d.). Methodology:
   Retrospective data on hospitalised COVID-19 patients were collected for
   this study, and the primary outcome measure was the patients' clinical
   status based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) Ordinal Scale for
   Clinical Improvement (OSCI) on Day-5 and Day10 post-steroid.Results: The
   results demonstrated that using steroids significantly improved
   patients' clinical outcomes from a WHO OSCI level of 4 (0.1) on Day-1 to
   2.6 (2.5) on Day-5 (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in
   clinical outcome between low-dose and high-dose corticosteroid treatment
   on Day-5 (H = 2.15; p = 0.34) and Day-10 (H = 1.12; p =
   0.58).Conclusions: This study concludes that using low-dose
   corticosteroids is recommended for hospitalised COVID-19 patients to
   ensure clinical outcomes are optimised.

   government. In Germany at present, 4398 suspected case reports for the
   diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections among health and social workers have
   been filed. This figure is four times the number of all reported
   infections normally received per year. The majority of claims,
   regardless of being a confirmed infection, concerned nurses (n = 6927,
   63.9%). The mortality rate for workers infected with SARS-CoV-2 is 0.2%
   to 0.5%. Doctors are affected by severe illness more frequently than
   other occupational groups (8.1% vs. 4.1%). In Malaysia, work-related
   infection of health workers (HW) occurred mainly when COVID-19 was not
   suspected in patients and no adequate personal protective equipment
   (PPE) was worn. Although knowledge on the spread of SARS-CoV-2
   infections among workers remains limited, the impact appears to be
   substantial. This is supported by the mortality rate among infected
   workers. Occupational health check-ups carried out at the present time
   should be systematically analyzed in order to gain more information on
   the epidemiology of COVID-19 among HW. Since the supply and use of PPE
   improved, the infection risk of HW in Malaysia seems to have decreased.

AB Academicians are facing new challenges as a result of the COVID-19
   epidemic and socioeconomic changes. They are exposed to occupational
   health risks such as stress and burnout. This study aims to examine
   burnout among academicians in Malaysia's public and private higher
   educational institutions. A survey of 328 respondents from all States of
   Malaysia was undertaken. The study was also conducted online, through a
   Google form and a Maslach Burnout Inventory form. The study showed that
   higher education institution academicians experienced 48% occupational
   exhaustion, 51% depersonalization and 46% low-level achievement.
   Academicians in public higher education institutions suffered 44 %
   moderate burnout, whereas private academics experienced 5%. Academicians
   from public higher education institutions suffered moderate
   depersonalization in 50% of cases, compared to 54% of private
   academicians. Furthermore, academicians from public higher education
   institutions had moderate personal achievement in 45 percent of cases,
   compared to 50% of private academicians. The result showed that Private
   higher educational institution academicians had experienced the highest
   emotional exhaustion compared to respondents from public higher
   educational institution at p<0.002. These findings are useful for
   preventive strategies or intervention initiatives to achieve social
   sustainability among Malaysian academics.

AB COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest communicable disease outbreak to have
   hit Malaysia since the 1918 Spanish Flu which killed 34,644 people or 1%
   of the population of the then British Malaya. In 1999, the Nipah virus
   outbreak killed 105 Malaysians, while the SARS outbreak of 2003 claimed
   only 2 lives. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has so far claimed over 100
   Malaysian lives. There were two waves of the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia.
   First wave of 22 cases occurred from January 25 to February 15 with no
   death and full recovery of all cases. The ongoing second wave, which
   commenced on February 27, presented cases in several clusters, the
   biggest of which was the Sri Petaling Tabligh cluster with an infection
   rate of 6.5%, and making up 47% of all cases in Malaysia. Subsequently,
   other clusters appeared from local mass gatherings and imported cases of
   Malaysians returning from overseas. Healthcare workers carry high risks
   of infection due to the daily exposure and management of COVID-19 in the
   hospitals. However, 70% of them were infected through community
   transmission and not while handling patients. In vulnerable groups, the
   incidence of COVID-19 cases was highest among the age group 55 to 64
   years. In terms of fatalities, 63% were reported to be aged above 60
   years, and 81% had chronic comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension,
   and heart diseases. The predominant COVID-19 strain in Malaysia is
   strain B, which is found exclusively in East Asia. However, strain A,
   which is mostly found in the USA and Australia, and strain C in Europe
   were also present. To contain the epidemic, Malaysia implemented a
   Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning on March 18 in 4 phases over 2
   months, ending on May 12. In terms of economic impacts, Malaysia lost
   RM2.4 billion a day during the MCO period, with an accumulated loss of
   RM63 billion up to the end of April. Since May 4, Malaysia has relaxed
   the MCO and opened up its economic sector to relieve its economic
   burden. Currently, the best approach to achieving herd immunity to
   COVID-19 is through vaccination rather than by acquiring it naturally.
   There are at least two candidate vaccines which have reached the final
   stage of human clinical trials. Malaysia's COVID-19 case fatality rate
   is lower than what it is globally; this is due to the successful
   implementation of early preparedness and planning, the public health and
   hospital system, comprehensive contact tracing, active case detection,
   and a strict enhanced MCO.

AB The world has witnessed the largest single disruption to social
   wellbeing since the first known case of coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) was reported in China in December 2019. In Malaysia, the
   government implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18 March 2020
   in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this paper highlights how
   the Malaysian government responded to COVID-19 in comparison with some
   Asian countries; and what has and has not worked for the MCO imposed by
   the government. The paper adopts a review approach that is supported by
   findings from both grey and academic literature. The findings reveal
   that the COVID-19 pandemic has significant impacts on the society's
   wellbeing in Malaysia, the most severe of which are negative mental
   health and job unemployment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has sparked a
   surge of volunteering in society. This paper presumably and hopefully
   represents a frontier review with more empirical research to be
   conducted to investigate the extent of the social impact of COVID-19,
   the outcomes of which are a call for re-envisioning of social policies
   in Malaysia. To the best knowledge of the authors, little empirical
   research has been conducted to explore the social-wellbeing implications
   of COVID-19 in Malaysia. By reflecting on the various scenarios-both
   detrimental and beneficial in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
   paper identifies potential avenues for relevant research in the social
   wellbeing realm.

   of intention to adopt preventive behavior by incorporating perception of
   e-government information and services and perception of social media
   into the theory of reasoned action. A cross-sectional online survey was
   carried out among Malaysian residents. Four hundred four valid responses
   were obtained and used for data analysis. A partial least-square-based
   path analysis revealed direct effects of attitude and subjective norm in
   predicting intention to adopt preventive behavior. In addition,
   perception of e-government information and services and perception of
   social media were found to be significant predictors of attitude toward
   preventive behavior. The findings highlight the importance of digital
   platforms in improving people's attitudes toward preventive behavior and
   in turn contain the spread of the infectious disease.

AB The emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing severe
   respiratory tract infections in humans, is affecting all countries of
   the world and has become a global health concern. Since the virus was
   first identified in December 2019, the number of deaths have been
   propagating exponentially, causing countries across the world, including
   Malaysia, to increase emergency measures to combat the virus. Due to the
   fact that the COVID-19 pandemic does not discriminate its victims, it is
   of paramount importance to construct a plan for management of the dead
   for all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including the
   unidentified deceased, as an essential portion of the humanitarian
   forensic action approach. This document provides an overview on ways to
   maximize the local collective capacity from various government agencies
   to manage the dead based on the prevailing regulations and legislation
   in the country, in preparation for possible large scale deaths from this
   pandemic. The National Institute of Forensic Medicine Malaysia has
   improvised procedures and guidelines for management of the dead within
   the existing regulations in order to achieve a balance between
   medicolegal requirements and the safety of personnel managing the bodies
   of the deceased with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection; at the
   site of death, during transport, during postmortem procedures, storage
   and preparation before and during burial or cremation as well as
   environmental cleaning and disinfection, involving various agencies in
   the country. A form of temporary controlled burial is as an option to
   allow the reinvestigation of a decedent to help formally identify
   victims of the pandemic such as undocumented migrants or refugees who
   were previously not identified. Due to the different legal requirements
   and mortality rates between countries, there is no one-size-fits-all
   approach to the management of the dead. Whenever possible, every
   opportunity and assistance must be given to families to mourn their
   loved ones, even in times of crisis or an outbreak, in order to sustain
   an appropriate level of dignity and respect.

   surveillance study aimed to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
   antibodies among the HCWs who were asymptomatic during the third wave of
   COVID-19 in Malaysia. HCWs from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)
   Health Campus were prospectively recruited between August 2020 and March
   2021 on a voluntary basis. Data on socio-demographics, possible risk
   factors and travel history were recorded. Serological diagnoses from
   serum samples were examined for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
   using an immunoassay kit. A literature survey was performed on the
   compliance with infection and prevention control (IPC) practices for
   COVID-19 among HCWs. The majority of the total 617 HCWs participating in
   this study were nurses (64.3%, n = 397), followed by health attendants
   (20.9%, n = 129), medical doctors (9.6%, n = 59) and others (6.3%, n =
   39). Of those, 28.2% (n = 174) claimed to have exposure to COVID-19
   cases, including history of close contact and casual contact with
   infected patients. Most importantly, all serum samples were found to be
   non-reactive to SARS-CoV-2, although nearly half (40.0%, n = 246) of the
   HCWs had been involved directly in the management of acute respiratory
   illness cases. A proportion of 12.7% (n = 78) of the HCWs reported
   having underlying health problems, such as diabetes mellitus,
   hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Despite the presence of medical and
   sociological risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections, the current
   study found zero prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among the
   HCWs of USM. Based on the literature survey, the vast majority of
   Malaysian HCWs demonstrated good IPC practices during the pandemic
   (average percentage ranged between 92.2% and 99.8%). High compliance
   with IPC measures may have led to the low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2
   among the HCWs.

AB Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths can occur in hospitals or
   otherwise. In Malaysia, COVID-19 deaths occurring outside of the
   hospital and subsequently brought to the hospital are known as
   brought-in-dead (BID) cases. To date, the characteristics of BID
   COVID-19 cases in Malaysia are not clear. The objectives of this study
   are 2-fold: to explore the characteristics of 29,155 mortality cases in
   Malaysia and determine the factors associated with the high probability
   of BID, using the multilevel logistic regression model. Data on COVID-19
   mortality cases from the entire country between March 17, 2020 and
   November 3, 2021 were retrieved from a national open data source. Of the
   29,155 COVID-19 mortality cases, 5,903 (20.2%) were BID. A higher
   probability of BID (p < 0.05) was seen among individuals aged between 18
   and 59 years, non-Malaysians, had no comorbidities, did not receive
   COVID-19 vaccination, and the interval between the date of death and
   diagnosis. A high prevalence of BID is an alarming public health issue,
   as this may signal health system failure at one or several levels and,
   hence, need urgent attention from relevant stakeholders. Based on the
   findings of this study, increasing the intensity of the vaccination
   campaign, addressing any issues faced by noncitizens about to COVID-19
   management in- and out-of-hospital, increasing the awareness of signs
   and symptoms of worsening COVID-19 and, hence, the significance of
   self-monitoring, and determining the potential gaps in the health system
   may contribute to their increased risk of deaths.

   (2015 to 2019) and a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
   (SARIMA) model that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the
   trend of dengue incidence during the first two weeks (stage 1) of
   lockdown decreased significantly with the incidences lower than the
   lower confidence level (LCL) of SARIMA. By comparing the magnitude of
   the gradient of decrease, the trend is 319% steeper than the trend
   observed in previous years and 650% steeper than the simulated model,
   indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue
   transmission. However, starting from stage 2 of lockdown, the dengue
   incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by four weeks
   and grew with an exponential pattern. We revealed that Aedes albopictus
   is the predominant species and demonstrated a strong correlation with
   the locally reported dengue incidences, and therefore we proposed the
   possible diffusive effect of the vector that led to a higher
   acceleration of incidence rate.

AB Mitigation measures and control strategies relating to novel coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been widely applied in many countries in
   order to reduce the transmission of this pandemic disease. A Movement
   Control Order (MCO) was implemented in Malaysia starting from the March
   18, 2020 as a pandemic control strategy which restricted all movement
   and daily outdoor activities. To investigate the impact of MCO, air
   pollutants: particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10
   mm (PM10), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5
   mm (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3)
   and carbon monoxide (CO) in nine major cities in Malaysia were measured
   before and during the implementation of the MCO. The non-carcinogenic
   health risk assessments of the air pollutants are also determined using
   the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Health Risk
   Assessment method. Overall, NO2 recorded an average percentage reduction
   of 40% with the highest reduction observed at Kota Kinabalu (62%). The
   largest reductions of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, O-3 and CO were recorded at Kota
   Kinabalu (17%), Kuantan (9.5%), Alor Star (38%), Kota Bharu (15%), and
   Ipoh (27%) respectively. All cities had hazard quotient (HQ) values of

   average hazard index (HI) value of 1.44E-01 (before the MCO) and
   1.40E-01 (during the MCO) showed higher human health risks before the
   MCO than during the MCO. This study gives confidence to regulatory
   bodies that the reduction of human activities significantly reduces air
   pollution and increases human health and so good air pollution control
   strategies can provide crucial impacts, especially in reducing air
   pollution and improving human health.

AB Neurosurgeons in Sabah were in a dilemma when Covid-19 became a pandemic
   and manpower was diverted into becoming front-liners at screening
   centers. Careful screening was introduced for cases requiring admission
   to the ward. We labelled our patients who are going for surgery into
   high and low risk categories. Level 3 PPE was used for high risk cases
   only. Emergency and semi emergency cases were continued with careful
   consideration. Elective cases were postponed based on the idea that we
   don't clog up the intensive care unit(ICU) beds and ventilators which
   might be needed for ill Covid-19 patients or avoidable usage of blood
   products which are in acute shortage during this pandemic. All
   outpatient clinic cases were screened by neurosurgeons and only those
   awaiting surgeries or those recently discharged home after major
   procedures were seen while others were managed via tele-medicine. Staff
   were divided to ensure that if someone becomes a positive contact, then
   it is easier to quarantine them. We believe that this is the first
   neurosurgery related article to the management of patient care during
   this pandemic in eastern Borneo and the approach we have taken can serve
   as a guide to most neurosurgeons during this unexpected time of Covid-19
   pandemic.

   among older adults is of urgent public health importance. This study
   presents a review of the COVID-19-related death cases among older adults
   in Malaysia. Clinical and social demographic data of death cases
   officially released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia were reviewed. As
   of 12 June 2020, 81 older adult death cases were identified and included
   in this study. The mean age of the death cases was 71.88 years old. Even
   though 79% of these cases were male, gender was not likely to be
   associated with mortality. A substantial difference between the
   prevalence of diabetes among death cases and the nationwide population
   indicated that diabetes was more likely to be associated with mortality.
   Most of the studied deaths were individuals with pre-existing medical
   conditions, predominantly diabetes and hypertension, and those aged 70
   years old or above. The mean time from hospitalisation to death was
   11.83 days. Extra focus should be given to older adults in the
   prevention and control of COVID-19.

AB Introduction: As of 3rd June 2021, Malaysia is experiencing a resurgence
   of COVID-19 cases. In response, the federal government has implemented
   various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) under a series of
   Movement Control Orders and, more recently, a vaccination campaign to
   regain epidemic control. In this study, we assessed the potential for
   the vaccination campaign to control the epidemic in Malaysia and four
   high-burden regions of interest, under various public health response
   scenarios. Methods: A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered
   compartmental model was developed that included two sequential
   incubation and infectious periods, with stratification by clinical
   state. The model was further stratified by age and incorporated
   population mobility to capture NPIs and micro-distancing (behaviour
   changes not captured through population mobility). Emerging variants of
   concern (VoC) were included as an additional strain competing with the
   existing wild-type strain. Several scenarios that included different
   vaccination strategies (i.e. vaccines that reduce disease severity
   and/or prevent infection, vaccination coverage) and mobility
   restrictions were implemented. Results: The national model and the
   regional models all fit well to notification data but underestimated ICU
   occupancy and deaths in recent weeks, which may be attributable to
   increased severity of VoC or saturation of case detection. However, the
   true case detection proportion showed wide credible intervals,
   highlighting incomplete understanding of the true epidemic size. The
   scenario projections suggested that under current vaccination rates
   complete relaxation of all NPIs would trigger a major epidemic. The
   results emphasise the importance of micro-distancing, maintaining
   mobility restrictions during vaccination roll-out and accelerating the
   pace of vaccination for future control. Malaysia is particularly
   susceptible to a major COVID-19 resurgence resulting from its limited
   population immunity due to the country's historical success in
   maintaining control throughout much of 2020.

AB The Malaysian government implemented The Movement Control Order (MCO) on
   18 March 2020 to control the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. However,
   the third wave that started in September 2020 during the Recovery
   Movement Control Order (RMCO) phase saw a continuous increase in the
   number of cases. In this study, the exploratory spatial data analysis
   (ESDA) was used to analyse the existence of COVID-19 spatial clusters.
   Moran's index was used to map the spatial autocorrelation (cluster) to
   showcase the spreading patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia.
   The study results indicated significant changes in the COVID-19 hotspots
   over time. At the beginning of 2020, the state of Selangor and Sarawak
   were the first locality to become a significant COVID-19 hotspot.
   Furthermore, this research showed all affected areas during the study
   period. Overall, a non-random distribution of COVID-19 occurrences was
   detected, thus suggesting a positive spatial autocorrelation. Many
   parties are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those involved
   in healthcare provision, financial assistance allocation, and law
   enforcement. Other sectors such as the economy, education, and religion
   are also affected. Therefore, the findings from this study will provide
   useful information to all the related governmental and private agencies,
   as well as policymakers and researchers.

AB Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel pneumonia
   disease originating in Wuhan, was confirmed by the World Health
   Organization on January 12, 2020 before becoming an outbreak in all
   countries.
   Outbreak situation: A stringent screening process at all airports in
   Malaysia was enforced after the first case outside China was reported in
   Thailand. Up to April 14, 2020, Malaysia had reported two waves of
   COVID-19 cases, with the first wave ending successfully within less than
   2 months. In early March 2020, the second wave occurred, with worrying
   situations.
   Actions taken: The Government of Malaysia enforced a Movement Control
   Order starting on March 18, 2020 to break the chain of COVID-19. The
   media actively spread the hashtag #stayhome. Non-governmental
   organizations, as well as prison inmates, started to produce personal
   protective equipment for frontliners. Various organizations hosted
   fundraising events to provide essentials mainly to hospitals. A
   provisional hospital was set up and collaborations with healthcare
   service providers were granted, while additional laboratories were
   assigned to enhance the capabilities of the Ministry of Health.
   Economic downturn: An initial financial stimulus amounting to RM 20.0
   billion was released in February 2020, before the highlighted PRIHATIN
   Package, amounting to RM 250 billion, was announced. The PRIHATIN
   Package has provided governmental support to society, covering people of
   various backgrounds from students and families to business owners. (C)

AB Alterations in the three chemosensory modalities-smell, taste, and
   chemesthesis-have been implicated in Coronavirus Disease 2019
   (COVID-19), yet emerging data suggest a wide geographic and ethnic
   variation in the prevalence of these symptoms. Studies on chemosensory
   disorders in COVID-19 have predominantly focused on Caucasian
   populations whereas Asians remain understudied. We conducted a
   nationwide, multicentre cross-sectional study using an online
   questionnaire on a cohort of RT-PCR-confirmed adult COVID-19 patients in
   Malaysia between 6 June and 30 November 2020. The aim of our study was
   to investigate their presenting symptoms and assess their chemosensory
   function using self-ratings of perceived smell, taste, chemesthesis, and
   nasal blockage. In this cohort of 498 patients, 41.4% reported smell
   and/or taste loss when diagnosed with COVID-19, which was the commonest
   symptom. Blocked nose, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal
   disturbances were independent predictors of smell and/or taste loss on
   multivariate analysis. Self-ratings of chemosensory function revealed a
   reduction in smell, taste, and chemesthesis across the entire cohort of
   patients that was more profound among those reporting smell and/or taste
   loss as their presenting symptom. Perceived nasal obstruction accounted
   for only a small proportion of changes in smell and taste, but not for
   chemesthesis, supporting viral disruption of sensorineural mechanisms as
   the dominant aetiology of chemosensory dysfunction. Our study suggests
   that chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 is more widespread than
   previously reported among Asians and may be related to the infectivity
   of viral strains. Study Registration: NMRR-20-934-54803 and NCT04390165.

AB The year 2020 saw the emergence of a novel coronavirus-the severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-which has led to an unprecedented
   pandemic that has shaken the entire world. The pandemic has been a new
   experience for Malaysia, especially during the implementation of
   large-scale public health and social measures called the Movement
   Control Other (MCO). This paper seeks to describe the experiences of the
   Malaysian healthcare system thus far in combatting the pandemic. The
   Malaysian healthcare system comprises two main arms: public health and
   medicine. The public health arm focuses on early disease detection,
   contact tracing, quarantines, the MCO, and risk stratification
   strategies in the community. The medical arm focuses on the clinical
   management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients; it
   encompasses laboratory services, the devising of clinical setting
   adjustments, and hospital management for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
   patients. Malaysia experienced intense emotions at the beginning of the
   pandemic, with great uncertainty regarding the pandemic's outcome, as
   the world saw a frighteningly high COVID-19 mortality. As of writing
   (May 30, 2020), Malaysia has passed the peak of its second wave of
   infections. The experience thus far has helped in preparing the
   country's healthcare system to be vigilant and more prepared for future
   COVID-19 waves. To date, the pandemic has changed many aspects of
   Malaysia's life, and people are still learning to adapt to new norms in
   their lives.

AB Introduction: The novel coronavirus infection has become a global threat
   affecting almost every country in the world. As a result, it has become
   important to understand the disease trends in order to mitigate its
   effects. The aim of this study is firstly to develop a prediction model
   for daily confirmed COVID-19 cases based on several covariates, and
   secondly, to select the best prediction model based on a subset of these
   covariates.
   Methodology: This study was conducted using daily confirmed cases of
   COVID-19 collected from the official Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH)
   and John Hopkins University websites. An Autoregressive Integrated
   Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the training data of observed
   cases from 22 January to 31 March 2020, and subsequently validated using
   data on cases from 1 April to 17 April 2020. The ARIMA model
   satisfactorily forecasted the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from 18
   April 2020 to 1 May 2020 (the testing phase).
   Results: The ARIMA (0,1,0) model produced the best fit to the observed
   data with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 16.01 and a
   Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) value of 4.170. The forecasted values
   showed a downward trend of COVID-19 cases until 1 May 2020. Observed
   cases during the forecast period were accurately predicted and were
   placed within the prediction intervals generated by the fitted model.
   Conclusions: This study finds that ARIMA models with optimally selected
   covariates are useful tools for monitoring and predicting trends of
   COVID-19 cases in Malaysia.

   multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
   model to determine the effects for the entire study period and four
   sub-periods, i.e. pre-government intervention, movement control order
   (MCO), conditional MCO (CMCO) and recovery MCO phases. Findings This
   paper finds no evidence of the effect of the daily growth in confirmed
   COVID-19 cases on the returns of FBMKLCI and eight Bursa Malaysia
   sectorial indices for the full study period. However, the former has
   exerted different effects over the four sub-periods. Sectors that are
   positively affected for the MCO period are financial services and real
   estate investment trust. Yet, these sectors are negatively affected for
   the CMCO period along with the industrial products and services and

PY 2022
AB Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic most certainly impacted the mental
   health of healthcare professionals in Malaysia. Aim: The aim of our
   research is to assess the mental health of house officers in Malaysia
   during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare this with the pre-pandemic
   times. Method: 122 house officers from 28 hospitals in Malaysia were
   recruited into the study and completed an online questionnaire of their
   demographics, including the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21
   items (DASS-21), Satisfaction with Life Scale and Brief Resilience
   Scale. Results: Results showed that depression (36.1%), anxiety (33.7%)
   and stress (23.8%) were all prevalent among house officers with
   depression being the most prevalent among the three. Majority of the
   house officers were slightly satisfied with life (30.3%) and most of
   them had normal resilience (71.3%). Discussion: We compared our study
   with 5 other studies from 2010 to 2017 and found similar prevalence in
   depression, anxiety and stress except for the study in 2017 which showed
   overall prevalence in depression, anxiety and stress. 8.2% of our
   subjects recorded extremely severe depression, which is almost twice as
   much as the two studies we have for comparison. Conclusion: Housemanship
   training in Malaysia is indeed a stressful period for junior doctors
   especially in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. More support systems
   should be made.

AB Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the current worldwide pandemic as
   declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Being
   part of the ongoing global pandemic, Malaysia has recorded a total of
   8639 COVID-19 cases and 121 deaths as of 30th June 2020. This study aims
   to detect spatial clusters of COVID-19 in Malaysia using the Spatial
   Scan Statistic (SaTScan (TM)) to guide control authorities on
   prioritizing locations for targeted interventions. The spatial analyses
   were conducted on a monthly basis at the state-level from March to
   September 2020. The results show that the most likely cluster of
   COVID-19 occurred in West Malaysia repeatedly from March to June,
   covering three counties (two federal territories and one neighbouring
   state) and moved to East Malaysia in July covering two other counties.
   The most likely cluster shows a tendency of having moved from the
   western part to the eastern part of the country. These results provide
   information that can be used for the evidence-based interventions to
   control the spread of COVID-19 in Malaysia.

AB Background Hospitals are vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks. Intrahospital
   transmission of the disease is a threat to the healthcare systems as it
   increases morbidity and mortality among patients. It is imperative to
   deepen our understanding of transmission events in hospital-associated
   cases of COVID-19 for timely implementation of infection prevention and
   control measures in the hospital in avoiding future outbreaks. We
   examined the use of epidemiological case investigation combined with
   whole genome sequencing of cases to investigate and manage a
   hospital-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases. Methods An
   epidemiological investigation was conducted in a University Hospital in
   Malaysia from 23 March to 22 April 2020. Contact tracing, risk
   assessment, testing, symptom surveillance, and outbreak management were
   conducted following the diagnosis of a healthcare worker with SARS-CoV-2
   by real-time PCR. These findings were complemented by whole genome
   sequencing analysis of a subset of positive cases. Results The index
   case was symptomatic but did not fulfill the initial epidemiological
   criteria for routine screening. Contact tracing suggested
   epidemiological linkages of 38 cases with COVID-19. Phylogenetic
   analysis excluded four of these cases. This cluster included 34 cases
   comprising ten healthcare worker-cases, nine patient-cases, and 15
   community-cases. The epidemic curve demonstrated initial intrahospital
   transmission that propagated into the community. The estimated median
   incubation period was 4.7 days (95% CI: 3.5-6.4), and the serial
   interval was 5.3 days (95% CI: 4.3-6.5). Conclusion The study
   demonstrated the contribution of integrating epidemiological
   investigation and whole genome sequencing in understanding disease
   transmission in the hospital setting. Contact tracing, risk assessment,
   testing, and symptom surveillance remain imperative in resource-limited
   settings to identify and isolate cases, thereby controlling COVID-19
   outbreaks. The use of whole genome sequencing complements field
   investigation findings in clarifying transmission networks. The safety
   of a hospital population during this COVID-19 pandemic may be secured
   with a multidisciplinary approach, good infection control measures,
   effective preparedness and response plan, and individual-level
   compliance among the hospital population.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic is of global proportions affecting Higher
   Education Institutions (HEIs), with online learning becoming a prominent
   approach to students' learning during the pandemic. However, minimal
   attention has been paid to researching online learning in Malaysia
   during COVID-19. This cross-sectional study examines students'
   perceptions of online learning during the pandemic. A sample of 457
   counselling students has been chosen using purposive sampling. Online
   questionnaires in Google Forms with an appended consent form were
   distributed to the respondents via WhatsApp with 184 respondents and a
   response rate of 40.3 per cent. The online questionnaire comprised
   demographic, students' perception towards online learning (a
   closed-ended question), reasons for liking and disliking online learning
   (two closed-ended questions), their preferable online teaching material
   and delivery (a closed-ended question), and suggestions to overcome
   online learning constraints (an open-ended question). Data collection
   was carried out in approximately two weeks and analysed using
   descriptive statistics. The results showed that the majority of
   respondents (84.8%) decided that the online learning approach was
   essential during the pandemic. Most students liked online learning
   because learning can continue even during the pandemic (75.7%), it was
   safer to study at home than to go to campus (63.0%), and it facilitated
   meeting the requirements to graduate on time (44.5%). Most disliked
   online learning because doing group assignments online was difficult
   (60.3%), attending online classes was challenging (59.8%), and taking an
   online test was challenging (55.3%). The respondents (50.0%) also
   acknowledged that the most effective teaching material and delivery tool
   for online learning was a PowerPoint with audio (asynchronous method).
   The respondents recommended internet stability and speed improvements,
   and a convenient space for studying online at home. This study
   contributes to the theory and evidence necessary for future research,
   programmes, and interventions to promote a fully digitally connected and
   informed society.

AB This study aimed to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 cases and
   close contacts during the first wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia (23 January
   2020 to 26 February 2020), and to analyse the reasons why the outbreak
   did not continue to spread and lessons that can be learnt from this
   experience. Characteristics of the cases and close contacts, spatial
   spread, epidemiological link, and timeline of the cases were examined.
   An extended SEIR model was developed using several parameters such as
   the average number of contacts per day per case, the proportion of close
   contact traced per day and the mean daily rate at which infectious cases
   are isolated to determine the basic reproduction number (R-0) and
   trajectory of cases. During the first wave, a total of 22 cases with 368
   close contacts were traced, identified, tested, quarantine and isolated.
   Due to the effective and robust outbreak control measures put in place
   such as early case detection, active screening, extensive contact
   tracing, testing and prompt isolation/quarantine, the outbreak was
   successfully contained and controlled. The SEIR model estimated the R-0
   at 0.9 which further supports the decreasing disease dynamics and early
   termination of the outbreak. As a result, there was a 11-day gap (free
   of cases) between the first and second wave which indicates that the
   first wave was not linked to the second wave.

AB Background and objective
   Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is one of the dreaded complications
   in patients after arthroplasty surgeries, owing to the risk of morbidity
   and arduous investigations and management associated with it.
   Nevertheless, as Malaysia is currently battling against the severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic head-on, the treatment for other
   non-life-threatening diseases including PJI has taken a backseat. In
   this study, we present a case series of 11 patients with PJI who were
   managed surgically at the largest tertiary hospital in Malaysia and we
   hope to shed some light on the difficulties we have encountered during
   this trying period.
   Patients and methods
   Patients with PJIs who underwent surgical intervention during the
   ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021) were
   reviewed and included in this study. The demographic profile of the
   patients, presenting complaints, prosthesis topography, biochemical
   investigative findings, surgical interventions, and short-term outcomes
   were summarized.
   Results
   A total of 11 patients were treated surgically at Hospital Kuala Lumpur
   for PJI. Among them, five patients are still awaiting their second-stage
   surgeries despite the completion of their antibiotic regimes, and they
   are fit for the procedure.
   Conclusion
   The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the treatment of patients
   with PJI. In a setting with scarce resources, surgeons should strongly
   consider single-stage revision surgeries for the treatment of patients
   with PJI.

AB Malaysia has the highest infection rate in Southeast Asia, with over 1
   million positive COVID-19 cases and over 8500 deaths. The National
   Immunization Programme, which began in late February 2021, had a
   particularly slow vaccination rate, with only 4% of the targeted group
   receiving vaccination in three months. The delay has sparked a lot of
   public debate and concern, especially in light of allegations of vaccine
   injustice, unclear prioritization, queue jumping by people in positions
   of power, and other aspects of the vaccination process. Using an
   interpretative social science approach, this paper examines the ethical
   issues that arise in Malaysia's COVID-19 vaccination discourse, focusing
   on vaccine justice and the bioethical principle of 'respect for
   autonomy'. The paper finds that despite several shortfalls in the
   immunization process, most Malaysians remain optimistic and support the
   government's immunization initiatives. The paper contributes to the
   understanding that building public trust is critical to the success of
   the immunization programme. Health agencies should make more efforts to
   inform the public about the benefits and risks of vaccines, as well as
   the transparency of immunization processes, which will increase public
   trust in health systems.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous social and life changes were
   implemented to curb the spread of the disease. The effect of lockdown
   and isolation predisposes the general population to various
   psychological health concerns. The existing determinants of suicidal
   behaviour were further added with social isolation, financial stress,
   depression, and other pandemic-related stressors. Hence, our study aimed
   to investigate suicidal behaviour and the associated factors among
   Malaysians during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a cross-sectional online
   questionnaire survey that used convenient sampling, where the survey was
   disseminated to the public via Google Forms through social media during
   the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. This study is also
   part of a large international COVID-19 mental health international study
   for the general population (COMET-G). This research revealed concerns
   about issues related to suicidal behaviours during the beginning of the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Suicidal behaviours were associated with depression,
   sex, marital status, educational level, employment type, residential
   area, number of people living together, number of children, and family
   dynamics. The pandemic effects from psychological, social, and economic
   perspectives will definitely take more time for recovery. Future
   prevention and protection are needed especially for the highly at-risk
   group on top of the general population in any future unforeseen
   circumstances of the pandemic.

   estimated at 31.3% effective (95% CI: 28.5, 34.1) in preventing ICU
   admission, and 45.1% effective (95% CI: 42.6, 47.5) in preventing death.

AB The first wave of COVID-19 epidemic began in late January in Malaysia
   and ended with a very small size. The second wave of infections broke
   out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities
   in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies
   collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different
   levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We
   examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key
   control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the
   epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval: 3.3,
   4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving
   time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt
   peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week,
   declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of
   April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the
   MCO. The experience of Malaysia suggests that adaptive triggering of
   distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control
   measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a
   rebound. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

AB In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck the globe and disrupted various
   aspects of psychological wellbeing, more so in frontline workers.
   Research on assessing the seroprevalence of COVID-19 has been scarce; in
   addition, there are limited studies assessing the association between
   the seroprevalence of COVID-19 and psychological distress. Therefore,
   this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 and the
   prevalence of psychological distress and to determine whether
   sociodemographic variables, occupational information variables, coping
   styles, and psychological processes might contribute to the development
   of psychological distress. A cross-sectional study involving 168
   Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) front liners was carried out to assess
   these issues. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was
   employed to assess psychological distress, together with the COVID-19
   Rapid Test Kit Antibody (RTK Ab) and a series of questionnaires,
   including a sociodemographic and occupational information questionnaire,
   the Balanced Index of Psychological Mindedness (BIPM) questionnaire, the
   Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS), the Acceptance and
   Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), and the Brief COPE questionnaire. The
   results demonstrated a seroprevalence of COVID-19 at 8.3% (95% CI =
   5.0-14.0). Non-healthcare workers (HCWs) had a higher COVID-19
   prevalence. Meanwhile, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress
   among front liners was low (3.0%, 3.6%, and 1.2%, respectively). Younger
   people (aged 30 years old or less) and HCWs had a higher prevalence of
   psychological distress; being a HCW was significantly associated with a
   higher level of anxiety. Dysfunctional coping and psychological
   inflexibility were consistently found to be predictors for higher levels
   of the three psychological distress variables. This study suggested some
   alternatives that could be explored by mental health providers to
   address mental health issues among front liners at universities.

   we utilize two unit root tests, which consider one structural break and
   two structural breaks. The findings reveal that the CFR follows a unit
   root process in Indonesia and the Philippines. However, the CFR is
   stationary in Malaysia. This evidence indicates that the COVID-19 has a

   Adding more analysis to date strengthening the information about the
   illness. Here, we analysis the data of Malaysian Ministry of Health from
   February 15, 2020 until January 10, 2021 was analysed using linear
   regression model statistical analysis with aim to forecast the trend.
   Materials and Methods: This study reviewed the data by Malaysia Ministry
   of Health from February 15, 2020, until January 10, 2021. Linear
   regression model statistical analysis was used for predictive modelling.
   The forecasting of the linear trend of the Covid-19 outbreak prediction
   is purposed to estimate the number of confirm cases according to the
   number of recoveries patients. Results: Malaysia is currently
   anticipating another lockdown restriction as new confirmed case of
   COVID-19 hit new record high. The cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases in
   MCO predicted a sharp increase. At the first of March, 2021, the
   predicted cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases are 319,477 cases.
   Conclusions: Covid-19 cases projected to 315766 by end of February 2021
   with 3000-4000 daily cases predicted. Initiative and proactive
   measurement by Malaysian government hopefully can reduce the number of
   cases and flatten the infection curve.

AB IntroductionThe unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected
   human health and socioeconomic backgrounds. This study examined the
   spatiotemporal spread pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia from
   the index case to 291,774 cases in 13 months, emphasizing on the spatial
   autocorrelation of the high-risk cluster events and the spatial scan
   clustering pattern of transmission. MethodologyWe obtained the confirmed
   cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Malaysia from the official GitHub
   repository of Malaysia's Ministry of Health from January 25, 2020 to
   February 24, 2021, 1 day before the national vaccination program was
   initiated. All analyses were based on the daily cumulated cases, which
   are derived from the sum of retrospective 7 days and the current day for
   smoothing purposes. We examined the daily global, local spatial
   autocorrelation and scan statistics of COVID-19 cases at district level
   using Moran's I and SaTScan (TM). ResultsAt the initial stage of the
   outbreak, Moran's I index > 0.5 (p < 0.05) was observed. Local Moran's I
   depicted the high-high cluster risk expanded from west to east of
   Malaysia. The cases surged exponentially after September 2020, with the
   high-high cluster in Sabah, from Kinabatangan on September 1 (cumulative
   cases = 9,354; Moran's I = 0.34; p < 0.05), to 11 districts on October
   19 (cumulative cases = 21,363, Moran's I = 0.52, p < 0.05). The most
   likely cluster identified from space-time scanning was centered in
   Jasin, Melaka (RR = 11.93; p < 0.001) which encompassed 36 districts
   with a radius of 178.8 km, from November 24, 2020 to February 24, 2021,
   followed by the Sabah cluster. Discussion and ConclusionBoth analyses
   complemented each other in depicting underlying spatiotemporal
   clustering risk, giving detailed space-time spread information at
   district level. This daily analysis could be valuable insight into
   real-time reporting of transmission intensity, and alert for the public
   to avoid visiting the high-risk areas during the pandemic. The
   spatiotemporal transmission risk pattern could be used to monitor the
   spread of the pandemic.

AB The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the community at
   large. It has affected almost everyone and every aspect of social,
   economic and educational activities. Training in reproductive medicine
   has not been spared, as training in this field requires a combination of
   clinical interaction with patients, procedural experience, constant
   discussions and the element of research. The changes to numbers of new
   infections or active cases dictate the restrictions placed on the
   community and health care services alike. At the beginning of the
   pandemic, both the patients' fear of going to a health care facility and
   movement restrictions had caused a significant reduction in the number
   of COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia's
   recommendation to withhold all non-essential medical services, including
   those related to reproductive medicine, falls under this category.
   Therefore, it could negatively impact the quality of training and lead
   to an extension of training duration in reproductive medicine. Thus, the
   procedural experience could be supplemented with simulator training,
   teleconsultation could replace standard clinic sessions and online
   meeting platforms could replace routine academic meetings. Any
   modifications must be adaptable or flexible, as similar infectious
   pandemics and restrictions could recur from time to time.

EA MAY 2022
PY 2022
AB Purpose Malaysia has experienced a significant surge in COVID-19. The
   "new normal" has plunged construction players into one of the most
   challenging times in their history, including the quantity surveyors
   (QS). Playing a primary role from pre-construction to post-construction
   stages, QS is essential to ensure project success. This study aims to
   clarify the impact of COVID-19 on quantity surveying practices to
   provide a better understanding of the construction sector's downturn
   during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach Preliminary exploratory
   interviews were conducted with ten QS, architects, project managers and
   engineers to identify quantity surveying practices affected by the
   pandemic, followed by a survey involving 222 respondents to determine
   the significance of these impacts. Findings It was found that quantity
   surveying practices involving site visits, such as variation work
   valuation and interim payment valuation, were the most affected by the
   pandemic. On the other hand, consultative services such as value
   management and advisory services were the least affected. Research
   limitations/implications The study faced data sampling limitations.
   Further research requires more insights on different groups of QS, such
   as consultants, contractors and developers, and reasons behind the
   difference in consensus between QS and non-QS respondents. Practical
   implications The insights from this research may help authorities and
   construction companies make necessary adjustments to ensure the quantity
   surveying profession remains resilient, hence a better chance of project
   success during a pandemic. This discovery can also be considered a
   significant opportunity to present the need for further development.
   Originality/value The findings are expected to explain how COVID-19 had
   affected the duties of QS and identify which impact is the most
   significant. This research will complement the existing publications on
   the impacts of COVID-19 on the construction industry.

AB Background and Purpose: Coronavirus has posed an unfamiliar threat to
   the world. Despite such circumstances, Malaysians continue to stay
   optimistic by keeping abreast with updates and mostly by seeking refuge
   in hopeful and consoling messages shared by fellow citizens. This study
   identified Facebook postings with positive messages, posted by
   Malaysians during the Movement Control Order (MCO) implemented by the
   Malaysian government as a form of prosocial behaviour.
   Methodology: Through an analytic framework consisting of Positive
   Discourse Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis, 15 Facebook postings
   related to COVID-19 were selected and identified as positive discourse,
   which were coded and categorised using a thematic analysis. Further
   analysis was also conducted on the linguistic features identified in the
   narratives of the postings showing the construction of positive
   discourse in the Facebook postings.
   Findings: The findings demonstrate an extensive utilisation of
   expressions of solidarity primarily through collective pronouns like
   "we" and "us", which suggest solidarity and empowerment among Malaysians
   in dealing with COVID-19. Further analysis reveals the forms and
   contextual functions of the linguistic strategies as carrying pragmatic
   devices (e.g. speech acts and figurative language), which contributes to
   the power enactment in the Facebook postings in creating an overall
   positive reaction.
   Contributions: This critical discourse study does not only promote
   positive discourse for its own sake, but also serves as a pragmatic
   approach to materialise utilitarian goals. It is therefore hoped to
   contribute not only to linguistics, but also social, psychological as
   well as arts and humanities studies through further examinations of the
   pivotal roles that communication and language play, especially in rising
   against dire situations.

AB When the teachers' training practicum was paralyzed during the COVID-19
   pandemic, preservice teachers in Malaysia were required to adapt to the
   online practicum. This qualitative case study was conducted with 20
   preservice teachers to investigate their online teaching practicum
   experiences. The study drew on the Engagement Theory and Disaster
   Management Cycle framework to further suggest teaching approaches that
   might be effective during a tragic situation. Data were collected from
   interviews and video observations, and analyzed thematically. The
   findings contribute to the understanding of how preservice teachers
   learn to modify their teaching practices during the challenging context.
   A number of themes related to positive experience were identified: (i)
   higher confidence level, (ii) improved interaction, (iii) engagement in
   active learning, and (iv) adapting to online syllabus. On the other
   hand, the negative experience revolves around the problem with Internet
   connection. It is hoped that the findings of this study will encourage
   preservice teachers to consider hybrid approaches and online teaching in
   the future.

AB Background: Implementing Chinese medicine (CM) for COVID-19 in Malaysia
   is challenging for local CM practitioners. The successful experience of
   CM in China can only be partially adopted in Malaysia due to differences
   in the national health care system and legislation, geographical health
   disparities and cultural diversity. Despite all the challenges,
   Malaysian CM practitioners have managed to thrive and found a Malaysian
   CM solution amid COVID-19.
   Methods: A literature review was conducted using various databases and
   gray literature from inception to August 15, 2021, to evaluate the
   challenges faced by Malaysian CM practitioners and the corresponding
   strategies in Malaysia's country context during COVID-19.
   Results: A total of 9 challenges and issues faced by Malaysian CM
   practitioners during COVID-19 were identified. Their corresponding
   strategies were further categorized into 3 phases, namely, preparation,
   development and implementation. The strategies were appraised using the
   SWOT analysis method, and 17 factors were identified. Strength analysis
   includes personalized CM prescriptions with online consultations in
   Malaysia. Limited research input for CM in COVID-19 and the inadequate
   research capacity of local CM institutions are discussed in threat
   analysis.
   Conclusion: Various approaches have been implemented by Malaysian CM
   practitioners to provide safe, qualified and effective CM services for
   COVID-19 at the community level, aiming to reduce the national health
   care burden. A public-private partnership initiative can bridge the
   knowledge gap and optimize the role of CM in the health emergency
   system. This Malaysian CM solution can provide insights to interested
   countries to capitalize on the potential contribution of Traditional and
   Complementary Medicine (T&CM) in the era of COVID-19. (C) 2021 Korea

AB Objectives: The transmission of COVID-19 has sent Malaysia into cycles
   of tightening and relaxation of movement control, which are still
   continuing currently in line with local fluctuations of new COVID-19
   cases. During movement control, measures comprising physical distancing,
   hand cleaning or sanitizing, and sanitization of premises are
   consistently implemented while self-isolation and travel restrictions
   are adaptively enforced. This study aims to examine if the control of
   COVID-19 transmission has an effect on the national influenza
   occurrences as some measures for COVID-19 control are similar to those
   for influenza. Study design: For this study, data of weekly new cases of
   influenza and COVID-19 were obtained from official platforms for
   non-parametric statistical analysis.
   Methods: This study compared the influenza occurrences before and after
   the onset of COVID-19 using the ManneWhitney U-test and explored
   Spearman's correlations between COVID-19 and influenza incidences after
   the onset of COVID-19.
   Results: It shows that influenza incidences before and after the onset
   of COVID-19 were significantly different and that influenza cases have
   significantly reduced after the onset of COVID-19. The weekly cases of
   influenza and COVID-19 were significantly and negatively correlated.
   Conclusions: This study underscores the co-benefits of COVID-19 control
   measures and alleviates the concern for the risk of COVID-19 and
   influenza co-infection. (C) 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health.

   especially industries that relies on air travel and tourism but resulted
   in the exponential increase of unemployment in Malaysia. At the same
   time, online business or trade and 'GIG' economy increased
   exponentially. The sudden and unexpected loss of jobs had dire
   consequences for many people. This paper examines how policies enacted
   during the Covid-19 pandemic affected unemployment in Malaysia by
   focussing on the situation in Sabah, one of the three remaining partners
   in the formation of Malaysia. It draws on data from the Family, Women
   and Youth Survey conducted online towards the end of 2020, as well as
   secondary data. The study shows that hardship has been faced by many
   people, especially those previously in professional rotes, and those who
   are younger. The widespread damage to the economy, and to social
   cohesion, wilt require significant collaboration between business and
   industry, the government and the people.

AB The first cases of COVID-19 materialised in Malaysia in January 2020,
   and the trend of COVID-19 cases boosted remarkably. As the globe changes
   its usual services and norms with digitalisation, many countries have
   used information technology embedded within digitalisation to manage
   COVID-19. This applies specifically for containment and contact tracing
   among Malaysian citizens. Malaysia is one of the first countries in
   Southeast Asia to have designed digital applications to control and
   manage the COVID-19 pandemic, hence making it one of the top 50 nations
   under the UN's 2020 E-Government Development Index (EGDI). This study
   intended to investigate the effectiveness of digitalisation in
   controlling the spread of COVID-19 outbreaks in Malaysia from 11 March
   to 9 June 2020 (90 days), with a specific focus on the aspects of
   containment and contact tracing. This research concluded that using
   digital applications and government administrative orders advised by
   national healthcare policy, through movement control orders (MCO) and
   conditional movement control orders (CMCO), slowed down the rate of
   COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. Similar endeavours by Malaysia's
   neighbouring countries have also administered current technological
   advancements to battle the pandemic with healthcare efforts.

   through social media that is directed to encourage public participation
   and engagement by providing comments, responses, and input to government
   agencies. Instagram, a mobile photo (and video) capturing and sharing
   service, has quickly emerged as a new medium in the spotlight in recent
   years. In this study, the researchers analysed the level of citizen
   engagement with Malaysia government ministries practices and calculated
   the engagement rate of each ministry on Instagram. This research was
   conducted for a period of one year which is from 1st January until 31st
   December 2020 through the formula of the Engagement Rate measurement.
   The data showed 21 accounts from 27 ministry Instagram accounts received
   a low Engagement Rate quality, which means 77.78% of ministry Instagram
   accounts had not been able to optimise their Instagram accounts to get
   engagement from their followers. Moreover, Engagement Rate is a very
   important measure for knowing Instagram optimisation. By knowing the
   Engagement Rate, we will find out how much influence the account has on
   followers.

AB Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19 complications due to
   gestation-related physiological changes. We aimed to evaluate the level
   of maternal knowledge, perception, and practice during the pandemic. A
   cross-sectional study was conducted during the Malaysian Movement
   Control Order (MCO) between April and June 2020. A self-administered
   electronic questionnaire that included the knowledge and practice
   domains was distributed. A newly designed set of questions was used to
   evaluate (1) women's perception of MCO and (2) maternal experience,
   which was subdivided into clinical care provision and maternal anxiety.
   The survey response rate was 93% with the final number for analysis of
   415. The majority of women (95%) demonstrated an adequate level of
   knowledge on COVID-19, whilst 99% had a good practice. We found that
   tertiary education (p < 0.001), employment status (p = 0.03), higher
   household income (p < 0.001), and multiple sources of information (p <
   0.001) were independent predictors of adequate maternal knowledge on
   COVID-19. Women with adequate knowledge also reported a more positive
   perception of MCO (p < 0.001) and better obstetric care experience (p =
   0.037), as did those of Malay ethnicity. Younger (p < 0.001) and
   nulliparous (p = 0.01) women demonstrated greater anxiety levels. The
   majority of our women reported good practice and adequate knowledge,
   which contributed to a positive perception of MCO and better maternal
   obstetric experience. First-time mothers may benefit from extra support
   and reassurance during the pandemic to alleviate maternal anxiety.

AB Through administrative research and media records, this paper aims to
   examine and highlight the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Malaysian
   workers, property development, construction sites, and the national
   economy. The development of real estate and the construction industry
   can significantly impact socio-economic growth and infrastructure
   development. Adequate building and infrastructure construction can
   ensure national economic stability, job creation, community cohesion,
   and higher living standards. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2019,
   many countries, including Malaysia, have reported an increased number of
   virus cases. According to the Ministry of Health, 9316 cases and 314
   COVID-19 clusters were discovered in Malaysia, with a 38.55-48.06%
   prevalence for factories, a 12.55-15.29% prevalence for community
   spreading, an 8.6-11.56% prevalence for construction sites, a 5.53-7.96%
   prevalence for educational sites, and a 7.01% prevalence for shopping
   areas. Several governments-imposed lockdowns, movement, and proximity
   restrictions during the pandemic due to the high infection rates at
   property development sites. However, due to inactivity in various
   sectors such as the construction industry, these measures have
   significantly impacted the national economy. As a result, the pandemic
   has had an impact on workers, production costs, and project completion
   timelines, resulting in operational issues and policy concerns. Overall,
   the records reviewed revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has
   significantly impacted real estate development, the housing market, and
   the construction industry. As a result, sustained and targeted policies
   are required to support Malaysia's construction industry's

   attitude (10 items), and practice (24 items) towards COVID-19. The
   collected data were subjected to descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U,
   Kruskal-Wallis H, and Spearman's correlation analysis. A total of 219
   students participated in this study, and they consisted of 52.1% and
   47.9% of veterinary and medical students, respectively. The total scores
   were categorised into poor (<60%), moderate (60-79%), and high (>80%)
   based on Bloom's cut off point. Overall, the students acquired high
   knowledge (80%), moderate attitude (76%) and high practice (86%) against
   COVID-19. In the attitude section, the veterinary student scored
   significantly higher than medical students (U=3791, p=.001), and female
   students scored significantly higher than males (U=3183, p=.001). The
   analysis revealed a statistically significant association between
   attitude and practice (P<.05) despite no association between knowledge
   to attitude and practice variables. Overall, the results indicated that
   both veterinary and medical students had high knowledge with moderate to
   high attitudes towards COVID-19. Thus, they were practising good
   preventive measures in limiting the spread of the disease.

AB Since the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak appeared in
   Wuhan, mainland China on December 31, 2019, the geographical spread of
   the epidemic was swift. Malaysia is one of the countries that were hit
   substantially by the outbreak, particularly in the second wave. This
   study aims to simulate the infectious trend and trajectory of COVID-19
   to understand the severity of the disease and determine the approximate
   number of days required for the trend to decline. The number of
   confirmed positive infectious cases [as reported by Ministry of Health,
   Malaysia (MOH)] were used from January 25, 2020 to March 31, 2020. This
   study simulated the infectious count for the same duration to assess the
   predictive capability of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)
   model. The same model was used to project the simulation trajectory of
   confirmed positive infectious cases for 80 days from the beginning of
   the outbreak and extended the trajectory for another 30 days to obtain
   an overall picture of the severity of the disease in Malaysia. The
   transmission rate, beta also been utilized to predict the cumulative
   number of infectious individuals. Using the SIR model, the simulated
   infectious cases count obtained was not far from the actual count. The
   simulated trend was able to mimic the actual count and capture the
   actual spikes approximately. The infectious trajectory simulation for 80
   days and the extended trajectory for 110 days depicts that the inclining
   trend has peaked and ended and will decline towards late April 2020.
   Furthermore, the predicted cumulative number of infectious individuals
   tallies with the preparations undertaken by the MOH. The simulation
   indicates the severity of COVID-19 disease in Malaysia, suggesting a
   peak of infectiousness in mid-March 2020 and a probable decline in late
   April 2020. Overall, the study findings indicate that outbreak control
   measures such as the Movement Control Order (MCO), social distancing and
   increased hygienic awareness is needed to control the transmission of
   the outbreak in Malaysia.

AB Over the last year, the dangerous severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly around the world. Malaysia
   has not been excluded from this COVID-19 pandemic. The resurgence of
   COVID-19 cases has overwhelmed the public healthcare system and
   overloaded the healthcare resources. Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia
   has adopted an Emergency Ordinance (EO) to instruct private hospitals to
   receive both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to reduce the strain on
   public facilities. The treatment of COVID-19 patients at private
   hospitals could help to boost the bed and critical care occupancy.
   However, with the absence of insurance coverage because COVID-19 is
   categorised as pandemic-related diseases, there are some challenges and
   opportunities posed by the treatment fees management. Another major
   issue in the collaboration between public and private hospitals is the
   willingness of private medical consultants to participate in the
   management of COVID-19 patients, because medical consultants in private
   hospitals in Malaysia are not hospital employees, but what are termed
   "private contractors" who provide patient care services to the
   hospitals. Other collaborative measures with private healthcare
   providers, e.g. tele-conferencing by private medical clinics to monitor
   COVID-19 patients and the rollout of national vaccination programme. The
   public and private healthcare partnership must be enhanced, and continue
   to find effective ways to collaborate further to combat the pandemic.
   The MOH, private healthcare sectors and insurance providers need to have
   a synergistic COVID-19 treatment plans to ensure public as well as
   insurance policy holders have equal opportunities for COVID-19 screening
   tests, vaccinations and treatment.

AB Background. More than a year after its first appearance in December
   2019, the COVID-19 pandemic is still on a rampage in many parts of the
   world. Although several vaccines have been approved for emergency use,
   the emergence and rapid spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants have sparked
   fears of vaccine failure due to immune evasion. Massive viral genome
   sequencing has been recommended to track the genetic changes that could
   lead to adverse consequences.
   Methods. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 respiratory isolates from the National
   Public Health Laboratory, Malaysia and examined them together with viral
   genomes deposited in GISAID by other Malaysian researchers, to
   understand the evolutionary trend of the virus circulating in the
   country. We studied the distribution of virus lineages and site-wise
   mutations, analysed genetic clustering with the goeBURST full Minimum
   Spanning Tree algorithm, examined the trend of viral nucleotide
   diversity over time and performed nucleotide substitution association
   analyses.
   Results. We identified 22 sub-lineages, 13 clonal complexes, 178
   sequence types and seven sites of linkage disequilibrium in 277
   SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced between January and December 2020. B.1.524
   was the largest lineage group. The number of mutations per genome ranged
   from 0 to 19. The mean genomic diversity value over 12 months was 3.26 x
   10(-4). Of 359 mutations detected, 60.5% of which were nonsynonymous,
   the most frequent were in the ORF1ab (P4715L), S (D614G and A701V) and N
   (S194L) genes.
   Conclusion. The SARS-CoV-2 virus accumulated an abundance of mutations
   in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Its overall
   genetic diversity, however, is relatively low compared to other Asian
   countries with larger populations. Continuous genomic and
   epidemiological surveillance will help to clarify the evolutionary
   processes determining viral diversity and impacting on human health.

AB COVID'19 pandemic has devastated several industries and solar energy is
   no exception. In its economic relief package, Malaysia has announced
   approximately US$ 2.9 billion in expenditure for the installation of new
   grids, LED street lights and rooftop solar panels. The Government will
   also open the tender for a 1400 MW solar power project in the year 2020,
   which is expected to generate 5 billion ringgit (US$1.1 billion) in
   investments. As these measures are intended to sustain the existing
   growth of solar energy potential in the country, it is vital to assess
   its status quo. Hence, this paper aims to review the current status of
   renewable energy in Malaysia as well as the initiatives taken before the
   pandemic to promote solar photovoltaic (PV) technology to meet the
   energy demands through the low-carbon pathway. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: Various public health and social measures have been used
   during the COVID-19 outbreak, including lockdowns, contact-tracing,
   isolation and quarantine. The objective of this manuscript is to
   describe outbreaks of COVID-19 in Selangor, Malaysia, the public health
   strategies used and the observed impact of the measures on the epidemic
   curve.
   Methods: Information on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Selangor between
   25 January and 28 April 2020 was obtained. Clusters were identified, and
   cases were disaggregated into linked, unlinked and imported cases.
   Epidemic curves were constructed, and the timing of movement control
   orders was compared with the numbers of cases reported.
   Results: During the study period, 1395 confirmed COVID-19 cases were
   reported to the Selangor Health Department, of which 15.8% were
   imported, 79.5% were linked and 4.7% were unlinked cases. For two main
   clusters, the number of cases decreased after control measures were
   instituted, by contact-tracing followed by isolation and home quarantine
   for the first cluster (n = 126), and with the addition of the movement
   control order for the second, much larger cluster (n = 559).
   Discussion: The findings suggest that appropriate, timely public health
   interventions and movement control measures have a synergistic effect on
   controlling COVID-19 outbreaks.

AB Vaccine hesitancy is a global health challenge in controlling the
   virulence of pandemics. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy will put
   highly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or groups with
   pre-existing health conditions, at a higher risk, as seen with the
   outbreak of the pandemic Covid-19. Based on the trends of vaccine
   hesitancy in the state of Sabah, located in East Malaysia, this study
   seeks to identify several variables that contribute to vaccine
   hesitancy. In addition to this, this study also determines which groups
   are affected by vaccine hesitancy based on their demographics. This
   study is based on a sampling of 1,024 Sabahan population aged 18 and
   above through an online and face-to-face questionnaire. The raw data was
   analysed using the K-Means Clustering Analysis, Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA), Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and frequency.
   The K-Means Clustering found that more than half of the total number of
   respondents (Cluster 2 = 51.9%) tend to demonstrate vaccine hesitancy.
   Based on the PCA analysis, six main factors were found to cause vaccine
   hesitancy in Sabah: confidence (var(X) = 21.6%), the influence of local
   authority (var(X) = 12.1%), ineffectiveness of mainstream media (var(X)
   = 8.4%), complacency (var(X) = 7.4%), social media (var(X) = 6.4%), and
   convenience issues (var(X) = 5.8%). Findings from both Mann-Whitney U
   and Kruskal-Wallis tests demonstrate that several factors of group
   demographics, such as employment status, level of education, religion,
   gender, and marital status, may explain the indicator of vaccine
   hesitancy. In particular, specific groups tend to become vaccine
   hesitancy such as, unemployed, self-employed, students, male, single,
   level of education, and Muslim. Findings from this empirical study are
   crucial to inform the relevant local authorities on the level of
   vulnerability among certain groups in facing the hazards of COVID-19.
   The main contribution of this study is that it seeks to analyse the
   factors behind vaccine hesitancy and identifies which groups more likely
   hesitant toward vaccines based on their demographics.

AB Background: Malaysians are disillusioned with the increased number of
   COVID-19 infection cases and the prolonged lockdown period. As a result
   of COVID-19 mitigation measurements, Malaysians are experiencing
   emotional and psychological consequences such as anxiety. Thus, there is
   an urgent need to have an instrument that could serve as a tool to
   assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 among Malaysians rapidly.
   Methods: This study aimed to adapt and validate the Malay version of the
   COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (M-CAS) among Malaysian adults. The back-to-back
   translation was done to produce a M-CAS. Following face validation,
   M-CAS was self-administered to 225 participants from Malaysia via an
   online survey. The participants also completed the Generalised Anxiety
   Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7), World Health Organization Quality of Life
   Scale, Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale
   (FCV-19S). Data analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for the
   Social Sciences and Analysis of a Moment Structures. The psychometric
   properties of the M-CAS were examined via Cronbach alpha and
   confirmatory factor analysis. M-CAS scores were compared with the other
   tools to provide external validity.
   Results: The statistical analysis revealed that the M-CAS demonstrated
   adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.890) and presented
   with a unidimensional factor structure. M-CAS scores were strongly
   correlated with GAD-7 (r = 0.511, P < 0.001) and FCV-19S (r = 0.652, P <
   0.001). Lack of correlation between M-CAS and WHOQOL-BREF showed that
   M-CAS scores did not reflect perceived quality of life.
   Conclusion: The M-CAS is a valid and reliable tool in the Malay language
   that can be self-administered among Malaysians to assess anxiety levels
   induced by COVID-19. The M-CAS has only 7 items and utilised little time
   in real-life clinical practice.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new postpandemic travel patterns
   as a result of the stay-at-home policies and restricted movement orders
   imposed by the Malaysian government. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the changes in individual travel behavior after the
   government imposed a series of lockdowns, also known as movement control
   orders (MCO). From March to April 2021, a questionnaire survey was
   distributed throughout Malaysia, and 435 complete responses were
   collected. Results indicated that the respondents predominantly chose
   private cars for various traveling purposes during the pandemic. When
   choosing a travel mode during the pandemic, married respondents and
   essential workers placed a significantly higher priority on
   pandemic-related - items such as cleanliness, infection concern, social
   distance, and wearing face masks, compared to single respondents and
   nonessential workers. Binary logistic regression models were developed
   to estimate individuals' propensity to make trips for different
   purposes, i.e., work/study, social activities, recreational activities,
   and religious activities. Results indicated that essential workers were
   nearly three times more likely than the general population to make a
   work trip during the pandemic. Regarding social and recreational trips,
   males were more likely to make such types of trips as compared to
   females. Furthermore, those who perceived a higher risk of infection
   were less likely to make social and recreational trips. Regarding
   religious trips, males were significantly more likely to make such trips
   during the pandemic as compared to females. In addition, Muslims had
   significantly higher odds of making a trip for religious purposes during
   the pandemic. The findings of this study could be useful in
   transportation planning when considering travel restrictions during
   pandemics based on peoples' travel purposes and mode choices.

AB Content from alternative news media often challenges the status quo and
   is sometimes viewed as a platform for the oppressed or minorities.
   Similarly, alternative news media in Malaysia are often viewed within
   similar roles. This research aims to analyse other roles played by
   alternative news media in Malaysia in light of the crisis reporting on
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous studies have studied issues of identity
   representations as framed in the news media. This research identifies
   sentiments of Islamophobia in Malaysia by looking into the framing of
   COVID-19 coverage from headlines produced by Free Malaysia Today for 90
   days. Thematic analyses were employed whereby 139 headlines and
   sub-headlines were collected, analysed and categorised according to
   themes. While this study acknowledges the counter-hegemonic role played
   by alternative news media as part of journalism practice in a democratic
   nation, the research highlights the need for more studies on alternative
   news media to understand its characteristics in various media systems.
   This is due to the salience in the responsibility frame found which
   indicates other underlying societal discontentment and divisions in
   Malaysia. Findings from this research provide a foundation for future
   research on the role of alternative news media in a country.

   and depressive symptoms among public. This study aimed to investigate
   the relationship between the COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude, and
   practice (KAP) and its psychological impact, such as anxiety and
   depressive symptoms in Malaysia population. A cross-sectional online
   survey was conducted from 8th to 22nd April 2020, involving 227
   respondents. The set of questionnaire included sociodemographic
   characteristics, the KAP questionnaire - 11 items on knowledge (K1-K11),
   3 items on attitude (A1-A3), 4 items on practice (P1-P4), together with
   Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder
   (GAD-7) Scale. To evaluate the data, descriptive analysis, Chi-square
   test and item response theory analysis were implemented. The percentage
   of respondents who answered the true statements items from Knowledge
   component (K1-K3) correctly was almost 100%. However, that of items
   testing on COVID-19 myths (K4-K11) ranged from 38.8% to 95.2%. The only
   item from Attitude component which had less than 95% being answered
   correctly was A1 (78.9%), regarding face masks usage. From the Practice
   component, over 80% of respondents identified that they used social
   media to obtain updates on COVID-19 all the time. This is alarming as
   most of the information circulating on social media have not been
   verified by relevant authorities, which might lead to, and continuously
   reinforce anxiety-inducing myths. This study showed that lower overall
   KAP scores, particularly for Knowledge component items, are related to
   higher anxiety levels and more depressive symptoms.

AB Background The Covid-19 pandemic has caused changes in the surgical
   treatment of non-Covid patients, especially in thoracic surgery because
   most procedures are aerosol generating. Hospital Kuala Lumpur, where
   thoracic procedures are performed, was badly affected. We describe our
   experience in performing aerosol generating procedures safely in
   thoracic surgery during the Covid-19 era. Methods Medical records of
   patients who underwent thoracic surgery from March 18, 2020 to May 17,
   2020 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients undergoing thoracic
   surgery were tested for Covid-19 using the reverse transcriptase
   polymerase chain reaction method. Patients with malignancy were observed
   for 10 to 14 days in the ward after testing negative. The healthcare
   workers donned personal protective equipment for all the cases, and the
   number of healthcare workers in the operating room was limited to the
   minimum required. Results A total of 44 procedures were performed in 26
   thoracic surgeries. All of these procedures were classified as aerosol
   generating, and the mean duration of the surgery was 130 +/- 43 minutes.
   None of the healthcare workers involved in the surgery were exposed or
   infected by Covid-19. Conclusion Covid-19 will be a threat for a long
   time and thoracic surgeons must continue to provide their services,
   despite having to deal with aerosol generating procedures, in the new
   normal. Covid-19 testing of all surgical candidates, using the reverse
   transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, donning full personal
   protective equipment for healthcare workers, and carefully planned
   procedures are among the measures suggested to prevent unnecessary
   Covid-19 exposure in thoracic surgery.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has forced millions of students to stay indoors
   and adapt to the new normal, namely distance learning at home, placing
   online learning in the spotlight. However, students' motivation for
   online learning and its effectiveness in skill development during the
   COVID-19 pandemic has not been widely studied. This study examined the
   relationship between students' fear of COVID-19 and students' social
   presence in online learning while investigating the parallel mediating
   role of student psychological motivation and cognitive problem-solving
   skills related to online learning. The participants were 472 university
   students in Malaysia and Pakistan. An online data collection technique
   using Google Forms was employed. Faculty members of the universities
   were asked to share the survey with their students. Moreover, using a
   snowball sampling technique, students were requested to share the survey
   with their friends. SPSS Statistics (Version 21) was employed to do
   preliminary data analysis, AMOS (Version 21) software was used to
   conduct confirmatory factor analysis using a maximum likelihood
   estimation, and Hayes' PROCESS model was used to examine proposed
   hypotheses. The results show that only cognitive problem solving
   mediates the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and students' social
   presence in online learning in Malaysian samples. In Pakistan, cognitive
   problem solving and psychological motivation mediate the relationship
   between fear of COVID-19 and students' social presence in online
   learning. The study found that developing cognitive problem-solving
   skills and providing psychological motivation could enhance their
   engagement with online learning.

   narrowing the scope of study to Malaysia. An alternative route was taken
   by employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify underlying
   themes or topics in these publications. Two separate analyses were
   conducted, one is to the paper's titles and another one to the journal's
   names. The findings identified three topics for paper's titles data are
   clinical study, impact of COVID-19 on various fields and Movement
   Control Order (MCO). The last topic shows the locality criterion in the
   studied papers as the term MCO was only used in Malaysia. For the
   journal's names, three topics identified were medical study, public
   health also business and education. Two papers with the most number of
   citations are both in social sciences. Investigating the properties of
   these topics, we found that papers on clinical studies are the ones with
   more chance to be cited and published by reputable publishers. These
   findings may help researchers on planning and strategizing for future
   research on COVID-19 specifying on Malaysia cases.

AB The rapid transmission of highly contagious infectious diseases within
   communities can yield potential hotspots or clusters across geographies.
   For COVID-19, the impact of population density on transmission models
   demonstrates mixed findings. This study aims to determine the
   correlations between population density, clusters, and COVID-19
   incidence across districts and regions in Malaysia. This countrywide
   ecological study was conducted between 22 January 2021 and 4 February
   2021 involving 51,476 active COVID-19 cases during Malaysia's third wave
   of the pandemic, prior to the reimplementation of lockdowns. Population
   data from multiple sources was aggregated and spatial analytics were
   performed to visualize distributional choropleths of COVID-19 cases in
   relation to population density. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used
   to synthesize dendrograms to demarcate potential clusters against
   population density. Region-wise correlations and simple linear
   regression models were deduced to observe the strength of the
   correlations and the propagation effects of COVID-19 infections relative
   to population density. Distributional heats in choropleths and cluster
   analysis showed that districts with a high number of inhabitants and a
   high population density had a greater number of cases in proportion to
   the population in that area. The Central region had the strongest
   correlation between COVID-19 cases and population density (r = 0.912;
   95% CI 0.911, 0.913; p < 0.001). The propagation effect and the spread
   of disease was greater in urbanized districts or cities. Population
   density is an important factor for the spread of COVID-19 in Malaysia.

AB While international tourism, in many ways, is a form of globalized
   neoliberal expansion subsumed in the dominant logic of capitalist
   accumulation, the Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally disrupted the
   global chain of international tourism. This has led to important
   reflections on tourism's neoliberal practices, structural inequalities
   and negative impacts, and the need for transformative relationships with
   capitalism that foster just and equitable realities. The primary
   objective of this article is to investigate the national-level responses
   to tourism transformation. Using the new Malaysian National Tourism
   Policy 2020-2030 as a case analysis, this study investigates the
   transformative agenda of the policy to explore and understand the
   dynamics at play in calls for transformation and (re)creation of tourism
   strategies in developing economies through the lens of neoliberal
   globalization. Qualitative interpretive content analysis is used to
   scrutinize the plan and policy contents from the selected government
   documents. The findings demonstrate the leading role of the market
   principles in action strategies and the limits to sustainability and
   transformation of capitalist tourism economies.

AB Objectives: To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics
   of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the state of
   Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia in the setting of mandatory hospital isolation
   and quarantine for all confirmed cases. Methods: A multi-centre,
   retrospective observational study was performed among children aged <12
   years with laboratory-proven COVID-19 between 1 February and 31 December
   2020. Results: In total, 261 children (48.7% males, 51.3% females) were
   included in this study. The median age was 6 years [interquartile range
   (IQR) 3-10 years]. One hundred and fifty-one children (57.9%) were
   asymptomatic on presentation. Among the symptomatic cases, fever was the
   most common presenting symptom. Two hundred and forty-one (92.3%) cases
   were close contacts of infected household or extended family members.
   Twenty-one (8.4%) cases had abnormal radiological findings. All cases
   were discharged alive without requiring supplemental oxygen therapy or
   any specific treatment during hospitalization. The median duration of
   hospitalization was 7 days (IQR 6-10 days). One (2.1%) of the uninfected
   guardians accompanying a child in quarantine tested positive for severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) upon discharge.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 in children was associated with mild symptoms and
   a good prognosis. Familial clustering was an important epidemiologic
   feature in the outbreak in Negeri Sembilan. The risk of transmission of
   SARS-CoV-2 from children to guardians in hospital isolation was minimal
   despite close proximity. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

   measures imposed by the affected countries. The total lockdown or
   partial lockdown devised by countries all over the world meant that most
   economic activities, be put on hold until the outbreak is contained. The
   decisions made by authorities of each affected country differs according
   to various factors, including the country's financial stability. This
   paper reviews the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on maritime sectors,
   specifically shipping, fisheries, maritime tourism, and oil and gas
   sector. The period of this study covers economic activities between the
   month of January towards the end of July 2020. Also discussed in this
   journal, is the analysis of the potential post-outbreak situation and
   the economic stimulus package. This paper serves as a reference for

AB Wearing a face mask has been a key approach to contain or slow down the
   spread of COVID-19 in the ongoing pandemic. However, there is huge
   heterogeneity among individuals in their willingness to wear face masks
   during an epidemic. This research aims to investigate the individual
   heterogeneity to wear face masks and its associated predictors during
   the COVID-19 pandemic when mask-wearing was not mandatory. Based on a
   survey of 708 Malaysian adults and a multi-variate least-squares fitting
   analysis, the results reveal a significant variance among individuals in
   wearing masks, as 34% of the individual adults did not always wear masks
   in public places. Female individuals, individuals who wash their hands
   more frequently, and those who reported more availability of personal
   protective equipment were more likely to practice mask-wearing. The
   identification of less-compliant groups of mask wearing has critical
   implications by enabling more specific health communication campaigns.

AB An electronic wallet (e-wallet) is the digital equivalent of a physical
   wallet that can support cashless and contactless payment, thereby
   enabling consumers' to meet the physical contact restrictions imposed to
   contain the spread of COVID-19. Hence, consistent with the increasing
   awareness of e-wallets, this study investigates consumers' intention to
   use e-wallets. Drawing on the motivation-ability-opportunity (MAO)
   framework, we investigated the factors of consumers' usage intention of
   e-wallets. The hypothesized model was tested using the survey data
   collected from 226 respondents in Malaysia. The results of partial
   modelling analysis of 226 respondents affirmed the significance of
   perceived COVID-19 risk, perceived government support, and facilitating
   conditions in influencing usage intention. However, effort expectancy
   was not a significant predictor. As hypothesized, facilitating
   conditions moderated the effects of effort expectancy and perceived
   government support on usage intention, but not that of perceived
   COVID-19 risk. Our findings demonstrated that motivation in terms of
   health risk avoidance and government incentives and opportunity in the
   form of facilitating conditions play significant roles in influencing
   the usage intention of e-wallets.

AB This paper discusses how household food security is affected by the
   Covid-19 pandemic, using examples from Sarawak, Malaysia. Food security
   in Sarawak was affected by the implementation of the Movement Control
   Order (MCO) that was introduced to curb the spread of the Covid-19
   disease. The MCO, and the subsequent phases that followed, imposed a
   varying degree of restrictions on movements in the country. This measure
   had serious repercussions on food security as it affects the
   distribution of food as well as how people access food. This raises
   questions of how secure households are in terms of food security, how do
   they ensure food security for their households and what are their
   greatest challenge in ensuring food security. This paper seeks to
   address those questions by examining the experiences and perceptions on
   food security during the pandemic based on the responses of 235
   respondents. Findings indicated that most households are food secure
   i.e. having similar access to food as prior to MCO and have not skipped
   any meals. In order to achieve this, households had to resort to various
   measures including switching their food sources, shopping online, and
   going without their preferred food. Significantly, the finding shows
   that food security means more than just having enough food but should
   also incorporate elements of variety, types and quantity of food. It
   also shows that the greatest challenge in achieving and maintaining
   household food security lies in the way household cope with the changes
   brought, both directly and indirectly, by the pandemic.

   styles, especially among oil and gas workers. This study aims to assess
   the prevalence of depression and anxiety among oil and gas workers, and
   subsequently examine the role of sociodemographic and occupational
   variables, various coping styles, and emotional distress in contributing
   to fear of COVID-19. A total of 299 oil and gas workers participated in
   this study. The DASS-21, Brief COPE, and Fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19) were
   used to assess the research variables. The descriptive analyses of
   DASS-21 indicated a prevalence of 26.8%, 33.5%, and 17.1% for
   depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively, among oil and gas
   workers. The results also indicated that all types of coping styles
   (problem-oriented, emotion-oriented, and dysfunctional-oriented) were
   significant predictors of fear of COVID-19. Sociodemographic and
   occupational variables and emotional distress variables were not
   significant predictors of fear of COVID-19. The study suggests how
   crucial it is for occupational mental health surveillance and prompt
   intervention for oil and gas workers.

   distance and lockdown measures. These unexpected changes created a
   significant impact on cellular networks, such as increased use of online
   services and content streaming, which increased the burden on wireless
   networks. This research work is basically a case study that aims to
   examine and investigate cellular network performance, including upload
   speed, download speed, and latency, during two periods (MCO, CMCO) in
   three different regions, including Kuala Lumpur, Selangor (Cheras), and
   Johor Bahru, to observe the effects of lockdown enforcement and other
   restrictions in Malaysia on cellular network traffic. We used the phone
   application SpeedtestTM as a tool for data collection within different
   times during the day, considering the peak times, including morning,
   evening, and night times. The research findings show how COVID-19 has
   affected internet traffic in Malaysia significantly. This research would

   responses, 93.2% of participants indicated that they would accept the
   COVID-19 vaccine if it was offered for free by the Malaysian government.
   The median out-of-pocket cost that participants were willing to pay for
   a COVID-19 vaccine was Malaysian ringgit (MYR) 100 (interquartile range
   [IQR], 100) if it was readily available and MYR 150 (IQR, 200) if the
   supply was limited. Respondents with a low likelihood of vaccine
   hesitancy had 13 times higher odds of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine
   (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.69 to 19.13). High perceived risk and
   severity were also associated with willingness to be vaccinated, with
   adjusted odds ratios of 2.22 (95% CI, 1.44 to 3.41) and 2.76 (95% CI,
   1.87 to 4.09), respectively. Age and ethnicity were the only independent
   demographic characteristics that predicted vaccine uptake.Conclusion:
   Public health strategies targeting perceived risk, perceived
   susceptibility and vaccine hesitancy could be effective in enhancing
   vaccine uptake.

AB Malaysia Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) aims to bring the
   business, education, tourism and other industry sectors back into
   operation. Due to movement constraints that result in local economic
   patterns, individual mobility patterns are expected to occur. However,
   this matter needs further investigation from people's spatial behaviour
   during the RMCO. Therefore, this research proposed a new technique for
   analysing people's spatial behaviour patterns via geo-tagged data. The
   data from social media users are gathered using data mining techniques.
   Geographical Information System (GIS) is used to show the geolocation of
   social media users and analyse their spatial behaviour. The finding of
   this analysis shows higher levels of movement recorded when the RMCO was
   enforced; a distinctive pattern where spatial trajectory length is high
   but spatial area coverage is low. It is noticed that the focal points
   are concentrated in urban areas and tourism attractions.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, key policies aimed at reducing exposure to
   the virus from social distancing, restrictions on travel through to
   strongly enforced lockdowns. However, COVID-19 restrictions required
   people to spend more time at home so the exposure to air pollutants
   shifted to being derived from that of domestic interiors, rather than
   outdoors or the workplace environment. This study aims to characterise
   the influence of lockdown intervention on the balance of indoor and
   outdoor PM2.5 exposure in a Malaysian suburb. We also calculate the
   potential health risk from exposure to both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 to
   give context to personal exposure assessment in different
   microenvironments during the COVID-19 lockdown, known locally as
   Movement Control Orders (MCO). The implementation of the MCOs slightly
   reduced daily average of outdoor PM2.5 concentrations (median of 12.63
   mu g m(-3) before and 11.72 mu g m(-3)). In the Malaysian apartment
   considered here, cooking led to a substantial increase in exposure from
   increasing concentrations in PM2.5 during a COVID-19 lockdown (maximum
   average concentration at 52.2 mu g m(-3)). The estimated excess risk to
   health was about 25% for lung cancer from staying indoor. Thus, there
   seems a potential for greater exposure to fine particles indoors under
   lockdown, so it is likely premature to suggest that more lives were
   saved through a reduction of outdoor pollutants than lost in the
   pandemic. Unfortunately, little is known about the toxicity of indoor
   particles and the types of exposures that result where people increase
   the amount of time they spend working from home or staying indoors,
   especially during periods of lockdown.

AB The coronavirus COVID-19 has recently started to spread rapidly in
   Malaysia. The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05
   April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the
   main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for
   the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using
   the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, with
   incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated
   using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy
   Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time
   forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the
   estimated infection rate is 0.228 +/- 0.013, while the basic
   reproductive number is 2.28 +/- 0.13. The epidemic peak of COVID-19 in
   Malaysia could be reached on 26 July 2020, with an uncertain period of
   30 days (12 July-11 August). Possible interventions by the government to
   reduce the infection rate by 25% over two or three months would delay
   the epidemic peak by 30 and 46 days, respectively. The forecasting
   results using the ANFIS model show a low Normalized Root Mean Square
   Error (NRMSE) of 0.041; a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of
   2.45%; and a high coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.9964. The
   results also show that an intervention has a great effect on delaying
   the epidemic peak and a longer intervention period would reduce the
   epidemic size at the peak. The study provides important information for
   public health providers and the government to control the COVID-19
   epidemic.

AB Malaysia was faced with a life-threatening crisis in combating COVID-19
   with a number of positive cases reaching 5305 and 88 deaths by 18th
   April 2020 (the first detected case was on 25th January 2020). The
   government rapidly initiated a public health response and provided
   adequate medical care to manage the public health crisis during the
   implementation of movement restrictions, starting 18th March 2020,
   throughout the country. The objective of this study was to investigate
   the relative efficiency level of managing COVID-19 in Malaysia using
   network data envelopment analysis. Malaysia state-level data were
   extracted from secondary data sources which include variables such as
   total number of confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases. These
   variables were used as inputs and outputs in a network process that
   consists of 3 sub processes i) community surveillance, ii) medical care
   I and iii) medical care II. A state-level analysis was performed
   according to low, medium and high population density categories. The
   efficiency level of community surveillance was highest compared to
   medical care processes, indicating that the overall inefficiency is
   greatly influenced by the inefficiency of the medical care processes
   rather than the community surveillance process. Results showed that
   high-density category performed well in both community surveillance and
   medical care II processes. Meanwhile, low-density category performed
   better in medical care I process. There was a good overall performance
   of the health system in Malaysia reflecting a strong preparedness and
   response level to this pandemic. Furthermore, resource allocation for
   rapid response was distributed effectively during this challenging
   period.

AB COVID-19 resulted in massive disruption and changes in every aspect of
   our lives. To curb the spread of the virus, many governments limited the
   movement of people or imposed full 'lockdowns'. This created significant
   challenges for social workers practising with people often reliant on
   interpersonal support such as those at risk of domestic abuse; with
   mental health problems or learning disabilities. Measures to reduce
   viral spread affected the education sector at all levels from pre-school
   to higher education, disrupted traditional classroom pedagogy and
   shifted to technologically supported e-learning to minimise disruption
   to the students' education. In lockdown, online teaching has become the
   new norm. E-learning has its limitations for professional curricula such
   as social work. Like most countries, field practice represents a
   compulsory component of the social work curriculum in Malaysia which
   measures the capabilities or competency of students to enable them to
   become qualified social workers. When COVID-19 forced universities and
   agencies to halt field placements in Malaysia, the immediate challenge
   was to find alternative ways of assessing students. This paper aims to
   provide an overview of field education assessment in Malaysia during the
   pandemic and to pose questions for future assessment as Malaysian social
   work drives towards increased professional regulation.

AB Background In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline
   healthcare providers who are engaged in the direct diagnosis, treatment,
   and care of patients face a high risk of infection yet receive
   inadequate protection from contamination and minimal support to cope
   with overwork, frustration, and exhaustion. These problems have created
   significant psychological and mental health concerns for frontline
   healthcare providers. This study aimed to compare the levels of
   vicarious traumatization between frontline and non-frontline healthcare
   providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methodology All the subjects who met the inclusion criteria were
   recruited for this comparative cross-sectional study, which was
   conducted from May to July 2020 in two hospitals in Kelantan, Malaysia.
   A self-administered questionnaire, namely, the Malay-version Vicarious
   Traumatization Questionnaire and the Medical Outcome Study Social
   Support Survey were utilized. A descriptive analysis, independent
   t-test, and analysis of covariance were performed using SPSS Statistics
   version 26.
   Results A total of 160 frontline and 146 non-frontline healthcare
   providers were recruited. Vicarious traumatization was significantly
   higher among the non-frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal
   mean [95% CI]: 79.7 [75.12, 84.30]) compared to the frontline healthcare
   providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 74.3 [68.26, 80.37]) after
   adjusting for sex, duration of employment, and social support.
   Conclusion The level of vicarious traumatization was higher among
   non-frontline compared to frontline healthcare providers. However, the
   level of severity may differ from person to person, depending on how
   they handle their physical, psychological, and mental health. Hence,
   support from various resources, such as colleagues, family, the general
   public, and the government, may play an essential role in the mental
   health of healthcare providers.

   Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. We obtained epidemiological and clinical data
   from patients with confirmed COVID-19, via phone interviews and patient
   medical records. We performed chronological mapping of the cases to
   identify the possible period, mode of transmission, and cluster pattern.
   Three laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified from the
   teaching hospital cluster. These three cases were linked
   epidemiologically to the religious gathering cluster in Malaysia.
   Seventy-four close contacts consisting of teaching hospital staff were
   quarantined. The median incubation period was four days (IQR 1-7). The
   need for intensified surveillance and a high level of alertness is vital
   to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in Malaysia.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had monumental effects on the
   mental health of populations worldwide. Previous research indicated that
   programs and interventions using social networks can play a positive
   role in promoting mental health. Nevertheless, current evidence is
   largely derived from high-income regions, reflecting an urgent need for
   more studies in low- and middle-income settings.
   Objectives: This paper aims to (a) describe the potential value of a
   hybrid health carnival in promoting mental health and increasing access
   to screening services; (b) assess the level of community engagement with
   the digital platform.
   Methods: A mental health carnival was conducted with the theme of "Mind
   Your Mental Health" (Cakna Kesihatan Mental) in conjunction with the
   World Mental Health Day in Malaysia. This was a hybrid carnival that
   combined elements of face-to-face interactions and virtual learning.
   Free online therapy sessions were offered to high-risk groups identified
   during the screening process. Social media metrics were utilized to
   report the levels of community engagement and participants completed
   pre-and post-assessments to measure the program's impact on their
   knowledge.
   Results: The carnival was attended by 515 participants (78.8% virtual
   participants). Social media metrics reported more than 5,585 reaches on
   Facebook for all the activities held throughout the event. Results from
   pre-and post-assessments showed significant improvement in the mean
   knowledge scores (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: This digital approach will continue to evolve by releasing
   new features and tools as a new frontier for high-risk populations and
   all individuals seeking mental health support and treatment.

   attitudes toward COVID-19 booster vaccine, having fewer concerns about
   the side effects of booster vaccination and the uncertain long-term
   safety of multiple COVID-19 vaccinations were found to create greater
   odds of a definite willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine booster.
   Findings from this study provided insights into demographic

AB Aim The first Covid-19 cases were reported in Malaysia on 25 January
   2019 followed by a quiescent period before an upward swing of the cases
   at the end of February 2020, partly attributed to mass gathering during
   a religious event. This short communication aims to provide an overview
   of the measures taken by the Malaysian Government in response to
   Covid-19, and of the effectiveness of the Movement Control Order.
   Subjects and methods This short communication reviews articles and
   government announcements related to containment measures and the
   Movement Control Order of Malaysia, and graphically presents data
   pertinent to Covid-19 in Malaysia in order to show the relationship
   between fluctuations in Covid-19 cases and movement control. Results At
   the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak, Malaysia had initiated travel
   restrictions and quarantine; but with a persistent increase in new
   Covid-19 cases, the Movement Control Order was finally rolled out on 18
   March 2020, requiring closure of all businesses except those providing
   essential services and items. Enforcement of the order was tightened
   progressively, resulting in significant improvement of compliance, while
   other interventions such as tracking of potential contacts and medical
   screening were underway, and the media continued to provide updates and
   general advices. The numbers of new and active Covid-19 cases started
   showing evident downtrends from mid-April, thus indicating the
   effectiveness of movement control and its compliance. Conclusion The
   article provides insight into crucial factors contributing to the
   success of movement control to effectively contain Covid-19, and
   highlights the need to prevent future upsurge through continuous
   monitoring and enforcement.

AB BackgroundIn Malaysia the COVID-19 disease (COVID-19) has continued to
   escalate since its first detection in late January 2020, despite
   widespread implementation of control measures. This study aims to
   determine the knowledge, perception and behaviors with respect to
   COVID-19 in the midst of the third wave of the infection. MethodsA
   cross-sectional study was carried out among staffs and students of
   Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR). The survey consists of basic
   sociodemographic information, 22 items on knowledge on COVID-19, 3 items
   on perceived self-risk, 2 items on preparedness & perceived
   self-efficacy, 10 items on preventive (own) measures, 9 items assessing
   unwanted and desirable behaviors during the pandemic. Simple and
   multiple linear regression were performed to determine the factors
   associated with knowledge, preventive measures adopted, self-risk
   perception, preparedness & perceived self-efficacy, and behaviors.
   ResultsA total of 434 responded to the survey of whom the majority
   (85.1%) had high scores for knowledge (mean score of 18.72 out of 22). A
   significant positive association was found between knowledge and older
   age (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.046 (0.022), p = 0.039), those from
   medical faculty (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.870 (0.420), p = 0.039)
   and residence in high-risk areas (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.831
   (0.295), p = 0.005). Predictors for higher perception of COVID-19 risk
   included presence of COVID-19 cases among social contacts (adjusted B
   coefficient (SE) = 0.751 (0.308), p = 0.015) and living with elderly
   (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 1.137 (0.296), p < 0.001), while that for
   perception of preparedness and self-efficacy were living with children
   (adjusted Beta coefficient (SE) = 0.440 (0.173), p = 0.011) and absence
   of positive cases among social contacts (adjusted B coefficient (SE) =
   0.418 (0.183), p = 0.023). Good preventive measures among the
   respondents were positively associated with knowledge (adjusted B
   coefficient (SE) = 0.116 (0.025), p < 0.001), as well as with female
   gender (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.348 (0.142), p = 0.014).
   Unwanted behavior was significantly associated with male gender
   (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.664 (0.321), p = 0.039) and COVID-19
   positive status (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 9.736 (3.297), p =
   0.003). Knowledge of COVID-19 (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.069
   (0.035), p = 0.048) and being married (adjusted B coefficient (SE) =
   0.917 (0.462), p = 0.048) were the predictors of desirable behavior.
   ConclusionOverall, the UTAR community had demonstrated a good level of
   knowledge and preventive behaviors, albeit with some areas for
   improvement.

AB Objective: Aged-care facilities are high-risk settings for coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks because residents have risk factors
   such as advanced age and multiple comorbidities. This report details a
   COVID-19 outbreak at an aged-care facility in Selangor, Malaysia during
   March-April 2020.
   Methods: Epidemiological and environmental data were gathered via
   telephone interviews and field investigations. Swab samples were taken
   from all residents and staff for laboratory investigation. Possible
   contributing factors to the outbreak were explored.
   Results: There were a total of 18 individuals at the institution: nine
   elderly residents and nine staff. The attack rate was 66.67% (6/9) among
   the elderly residents and 55.56% (5/9) among the staff. The most common
   symptoms reported were fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhoea.
   The fatality rate among COVID-19 cases was 18.18% (2/11). Both fatal
   cases occurred in people of advanced age (86 and 92 years old), who had
   comorbidities and had fever at presentation. The factors contributing to
   the outbreak included a delay in isolating symptomatic residents, the
   use of common facilities, caregivers providing support to more than one
   resident and a lack of natural ventilation.
   Discussion: Prevention and control measures must be aggressively
   implemented in high-risk sites to significantly reduce the risk of
   morbidity and mortality during COVID-19 outbreaks. Specific guidelines
   should be developed detailing the management of outbreaks in
   institutions such as aged-care facilities.

AB Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat
   to both the human health and economy of the affected nations. Despite
   several control efforts invested in breaking the transmission chain of
   the disease, there is a rise in the number of reported infected and
   death cases around the world. Hence, there is the need for a
   mathematical model that can reliably describe the real nature of the
   transmission behaviour and control of the disease. This study presents
   an appropriately developed deterministic compartmental model to
   investigate the effect of different pharmaceutical (treatment therapies)
   and non-pharmaceutical (particularly, human personal protection and
   contact tracing and testing on the exposed individuals) control measures
   on COVID-19 population dynamics in Malaysia. The data from daily
   reported cases of COVID-19 between 3 March and 31 December 2020 are used
   to parameterize the model. The basic reproduction number of the model is
   estimated. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the
   effect of various control combination strategies involving the use of
   personal protection, contact tracing and testing, and treatment control
   measures on the disease spread. Numerical simulations reveal that the
   implementation of each strategy analysed can significantly reduce
   COVID-19 incidence and prevalence in the population. However, the
   results of effectiveness analysis suggest that a strategy that combines
   both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures averts
   the highest number of infections in the population.

PD DEC 2021
PY 2021
AB The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a powerful non-parametric time
   series analysis that has demonstrated its capability in forecasting
   different time series in various disciplines. SSA falls in the framework
   of data-driven modelling of dynamical system which does not rely on any
   underlying assumption except the inherent dynamics which are captured
   over time. The capabilities of SSA are mainly aff orded by its direct
   connection to the singular value decomposition (SVD). It is generally
   accepted that SVDbased methods are very affective for the noise
   reduction in deterministic time series and consequently for forecasting,
   as well as for extracting trends and structures. Despite its strength,
   several shortcomings of SSA in the analysis of COVID-19 time series have
   been reported in the literature. The aim of this paper is to determine
   the scope of this limitation and we confine our investigation in the
   analysis and forecasting of COVID-19 Pandemic in Malaysia. We scrutinize
   the results fromthe SSA analysis of the number of daily confirmed cases
   to gain further insight into the intrinsic trends of the pandemic.
   Groupings of the singular spectra that contributes to different features
   of the pandemic time series are identified using analysis of the
   singular value spectrum, periodogram analysis and analysis of the
   weighted correlation matrix. It was revealed that under stationary
   conditions, the principal eigentriple is sufficient to produce reliable
   forecast. However, in non-stationary conditions, for example during a
   movement control order, it is useful to also study the minor
   eigentriples which could contain transient dynamics that may persist.

AB Physical distancing policy that is encouraged by the World Health
   Organization (WHO) has inspired consumers to do contactless activities,
   including payment transaction. Government authorities in a growing
   number of countries are taking actions to encourage contactless payments
   as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates. People are worried that novel
   coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) can be transmitted through physical money. It
   drives them to shift to e-wallet. Due to a lack of study on this topic,
   the present study contributes to the literature by examining the effect
   of perceived risk, government support, and perceived usefulness on
   customers' intention to use e-wallet during COVID-19 outbreak. To give
   more fruitful insight, another major contribution of this study is
   investigating the group difference between Indonesia and Malaysia in the
   overall model. Questionnaires are distributed to the respondents by
   using a proportional sampling technique. As a result, 259 total
   respondents from Indonesia and 207 from Malaysia are collected. Both
   countries are selected because Indonesia and Malaysia can be considered
   as the two-worst countries in ASEAN affected by COVID-19. The model is
   tested using PLS-Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. The
   results show that the effects of government support on the intention to
   use e-wallets differ between countries. Besides, perceived usefulness
   fully mediated government support-intention to use e-wallets
   relationship, and partially mediated the effect of perceived risk on
   intention to use e-wallets.

AB Depression is one of the most common psychological disorders and many
   people in the world suffer from this disorder. Every year, thousands of
   suicides occur because of depression. Whilst anxiety is considered a
   common phenomenon of our era, it has existed throughout human history.
   Nevertheless, there have always been signs of religion and religious
   beliefs in the study of human communities and the history of
   civilisations. Despite rapid advancements made in solving the physical
   problems of human beings, the science of medicine has not taken an
   effective step toward solving humans??? psychological issues, although
   they play a considerable role in the emergence of physical diseases.
   Religion can affect the mental health of individuals and society through
   various mechanisms. In general, the role of religion and religious
   beliefs on the health of the individual and society is very important. A
   great deal of peace of mind can be achieved based on faith and moral
   beliefs and practices. People with religious beliefs have an optimistic
   viewpoint towards life, and their religious beliefs turn a dark life
   into a bright one even when all hopes are lost in the battle of life.
   Given the importance of this issue, the present study aimed to evaluate
   the role of Islamic religious beliefs of Muslim students on depression
   during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Malaysia. A
   field study was performed on 3500 Muslim students of Kuala Lumpur in
   2021 by simple random sampling method. Data were collected using
   standardised questionnaires, and data analysis was performed in SPSS
   (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). According to the results,
   people with a higher level of religious beliefs suffered less from
   depression, which confirmed the negative and significant relationship
   between Islamic religious beliefs and depression. According to the
   results of multiple regression analysis related to the components of the
   independent variable in SPSS, all components of Islamic beliefs had a
   significant role in reducing COVID-19-induced depression. Meanwhile,
   action required (t-value: 2.30; beta: 0.55) and religious activities
   (t-value: 2.24; beta: 0.54) had the most effect on reducing depression

AB Background: Reports of co-circulation of respiratory viruses during the
   COVID-19 pandemic and co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 vary. However,
   limited information is available from developing countries. Objectives:
   We aimed to investigate the incidence of respiratory viruses in adult
   patients with suspected COVID19 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Study Design:
   We collected 198 respiratory samples from adult patients hospitalized
   with suspected COVID-19 in a single teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur in
   February-May 2020 and tested combined oro-nasopharyngeal swabs with the
   NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex) and Allplex RV Essential
   (Seegene) assays. Forty-five negative samples further underwent viral
   metagenomics analysis. Results: Of the 198 samples, 74 (37.4%) had
   respiratory pathogens, including 56 (28.3%) with SARS-CoV-2 and 18
   (9.1%) positive for other respiratory pathogens. There were five (2.5%)
   SARS-CoV-2 co-infections, all with rhinovirus/enterovirus. Three samples
   (6.7%; 3/45) had viruses identified by metagenomics, including one case
   of enterovirus D68 and one of Saffold virus genotype 6 in a patient
   requiring ICU care. Most of the COVID-19 patients (91.1%; 51/56) had
   mild symptoms but 5.4% (3/56) died. Conclusion: During the early
   COVID-19 period, common respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 only
   accounted for 9.1% of hospitalization cases with ARI and co-infections
   with SARS-CoV-2 were rare. Continued surveillance is important to
   understand the impact of COVID-19 and its associated public health
   control measures on circulation of other respiratory viruses.
   Metagenomics can identify unexpected or rare pathogens, such as Saffold
   virus, which is rarely described in adults.

AB Indonesia and Malaysia are currently holding prominent roles in the
   global palm oil market. Both countries are the top two palm oil
   producers in the world and have ambitious targets to increase the palm
   oil-based biodiesel mandate. In Indonesia, the current programme of
   blending 20 per cent palm oil into 80 per cent diesel (B20) increases to
   B30 in 2020. Likewise, Malaysia plans to increase its biodiesel mandate
   from B10 to B20 in 2020. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has infected
   millions and brought the global economy to a near-deadlock. The effect
   is particularly severe in the fuel industry owing to movement
   restrictions and the historic drop in oil prices. Evaluating the impact
   of the COVID-19 on the biodiesel industry is crucial for policymakers
   but challenging as the pandemic has evolved with intense speed. This
   article aims to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the Indonesian and
   Malaysian biodiesel industry. In addition to that, a number of possible
   solutions to overcome the challenges were addressed and proposed.
   Despite severely affected by COVID-19, both Indonesia and Malaysia can
   use this momentum to improve and strengthen their biodiesel sector.
   Given its fiscal deficit, Indonesia should postpone its biodiesel
   blending mandate as the subsidy to support the programme can worsen the
   country's financial stability. In Malaysia, where labour shortage is
   prevalent, modernising plantations with automated equipment, for
   instance, could potentially remove the dirty and dangerous stereotypes
   associated with plantation works, thus attracting more locals to work in
   the palm oil plantation and solving the labour shortage. This paper also
   briefly addresses the adoption of Industry 4.0 and Circular Economy for
   the palm oil biodiesel industry.

AB Background: Polio Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) were
   carried out in the State of Sabah in response to the Vaccine Derived
   Poliovirus outbreak declared in December 2019. Prior to this, Malaysia
   had been polio-free over the past 27 years. This paper reported on the
   successful implementation of SIAs in the district of Penampang, Sabah,
   adapting (vaccine administration) to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A
   series of meticulous planning, healthcare staff training, advocacy, and
   community engagement activities were conducted by the Penampang District
   Health Office. Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (bOPV) and monovalent Oral
   Polio Vaccine were administered over the period of 1 year via these
   methods: house to house, drive-through, static, and mobile posts. The
   targeted group was 22 096 children aged 13 years and below. Results:
   Polio SIAs in Penampang managed to achieve more than 90% coverage for
   both bOPV and mOPV. The overall vaccine wastage was reported to be
   1.63%. No major adverse reaction was reported. Conclusion: High vaccine
   uptake during Polio SIAs in Penampang was attributed to good
   inter-agency collaboration, community engagement, intensified health
   promotion activities, and drive-through vaccination campaign.

AB Novel therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2 have emerged over time, serving
   to reduce the severity of the disease, admission and mortality,
   especially among high-risk populations. Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir
   (Paxlovid(R)) was found to reduce the risk of disease progression.
   Pharmacists played multiple roles in handling the COVID-19 pandemic.
   This article highlights the roles of pharmacists in managing
   nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within the Malaysian context. Pharmacists were
   actively involved in Paxlovid (R) inventory management. To ensure the
   balance between supply and demand of new therapeutic drugs, pharmacists
   in health facilities constantly monitor the inventory levels of the
   medications. As Paxlovid (R) was initially reserved for a certain
   population who met the clinical eligibility criteria based on a scoring
   system, pharmacists were required to screen and exclude patients with
   non-indications or contraindications to the medication. During
   dispensing, pharmacists convey clear instructions on how to take the
   medications to ensure adherence and medication safety. The novel nature
   of the medications necessitates pharmacists to counsel patients
   regarding its indication, the mode of action, actions to take when
   missing a dose or overdose happens, side effects, storage and disposal
   methods, as well as mechanism of reporting adverse drug reactions.
   Pharmacists were required to follow-up all patients via phone call on
   Day 3 and Day 5 post-initiation, examining both adherence and adverse
   drug reactions associated with Paxlovid(R). Pharmacists experienced
   multiple challenges in managing Paxlovid(R), particularly due to
   increased workload, suboptimal follow-up response, stringent medication
   storage requirements, and adherence issues. Universal research and
   innovation initiatives were proposed to improve the delivery of novel
   therapeutic agents in the future health system.

AB Objectives: We aimed to investigate and compare waning vaccine
   effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 related ICU
   admission, and COVID-19-related death for BNT162b2 and CoronaVac
   vaccines.
   Methods: We consolidated national data on COVID-19 vaccination and
   outcomes, and used cases from September 1st -30th, 2021 to compare VE
   between the 'early' (fully vaccinated in April-June 2021) and 'late'
   (July-August 2021) groups. We estimated VE against COVID-19 infection
   with a negative binomial regression and VE against ICU admission and
   death among confirmed COVID-19 cases with a logistic regression.
   Results: For BNT162b2, VE against COVID-19 infections declined from
   90.8% (95% CI 89.4, 92.1) in the 'late' group to 79.3% (95% CI 76.1,
   82.1) in the 'early' group. VE for BNT162b2 against ICU admission and
   death were stable. For CoronaVac, VE waned against COVID-19 infections
   from 74.5% (95% CI 70.6, 78.0) to 30.4% (95% CI 18.8, 40.3).
   Effectiveness against ICU admission waned from 56.0% (95% CI 51.2, 60.2)
   to 28.7% (95% CI 12.2, 42.1). CoronaVac's effectiveness against death
   remained stable.
   Conclusion: VE against COVID-19 infection waned after 3-5 months of full
   vaccination for both BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines in Malaysia. For
   CoronaVac, protection against ICU admission also declined. (C) 2022 The

   information on the novel virus, its risks, and recommended preventive
   and control measures, 3) possess key components of infographic and (4)
   adopt a three-way process of engaging the target audience. The findings
   also reveal several key points worth considering in thinking about the

AB Malaysia has one of the highest total numbers of COVID-19 infections
   amongst the Southeast Asian nations, which led to the enforcements of
   the Malaysian "Movement Control Order" to prohibit disease transmission.
   The overwhelming increasing amount of infections has led to a major
   strain on major healthcare services. This leads to shortages in hospital
   beds, ventilators and critical personnel protective equipment. This
   article focuses on the critical adaptations from a general surgery
   department in Malaysia which is part of a Malaysian tertiary hospital
   that treats COVID-19 cases. The core highlights of these strategies
   enforced during this pandemic are: (1) surgery ward and clinic
   decongestions; (2) deferment of elective surgeries; (3) restructuring of
   medical personnel work force; (4) utilization of online applications for
   tele-communication; (5) operating room (OR) adjustments and patient
   screening; and (6) continuing medical education and updating practices
   in context to COVID-19. These adaptations were important for the
   continuation of emergency surgery services, preventing transmission of
   COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers and optimization of medical
   personnel work force in times of a global pandemic. In addition, an
   early analysis on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures
   in Malaysia towards the reduction in total number of

   presentations at hospitals and face-to-face learning were no longer
   feasible; therefore an online methodology was executed. Each student was
   assigned a real completed case clerked by a previous Master's in
   Clinical Pharmacy graduate. The students then critically evaluated any
   pharmaceutical care issues (PCIs) in each of the cases, recorded a video
   presentation for assessment by the lecturers and discussed each case

AB The third wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia has significantly strained the
   healthcare system of the country and increased the level of burnout
   among the healthcare workers (HCWs) in the country. Therefore, this
   study aimed to identify the various factors associated with burnout
   among HCWs. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 HWCs in Kota
   Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. An online survey was administered using the
   Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social
   Support, Brief COPE, and Fear of COVID-19 scales. Pearson correlations
   were assessed amongst all variables. Subsequently, a multiple linear
   regression analysis was performed using burnout dimensions as dependent
   variables. Multiple linear regression results showed: (a) lower
   work-related burnout (beta = -0.217, p < 0.01) among married HCWs; (b)
   higher personal-related burnout (beta = 0.228, p < 0.01), work-related
   burnout (beta = 0.425, p < 0.01), and client-related burnout (beta =
   0.359, p < 0.01) among doctors; (c) fear towards COVID-19 was
   significantly associated with client-related burnout (beta = 0.243, p <
   0.01); (d) an avoidant coping strategy was significantly associated with
   personal-related burnout (beta = 0.322, p < 0.01); (e) social support
   from family was significantly associated with personal-related burnout
   (beta = -0.264, p < 0.01), work-related burnout (beta = -0.186, p <
   0.05), and client-related burnout (beta = -0.326, p < 0.01); (f) and
   social support from friends was significantly associated with
   work-related burnout (beta = -0.202, p < 0.05). This study demonstrated
   significant theoretical contributions and clinical implications in the

AB Despite a profound evidence of the human unsustainable behaviours'

   especially in the context of the current epidemiological situation
   ushered by the COVID-19. The ongoing pandemic is a global public health
   concern due to its sagacious impacts on environmental sustainability,
   social responsibility and people's quality of life. This study primarily
   focuses on analysing the impact of COVID-19 (COV) on the environmental
   awareness (EA), sustainable consumption (SC) and social responsibility
   (SR). Additionally, we aspire to investigate the impact of demographics
   of generations and religion on the proposed nexus in this study. The
   data was collected from 700 participants of different age groups and
   religious backgrounds in Malaysia, and structural equation modelling
   (SEM) was used to analyse this data and test the hypotheses. The
   findings indicate that COVID-19 has a significantly positive impact on
   EA, SC and SR, and the generations and religiosity moderate the
   relationship between COVID-19 and its impact on sustainable behaviours.
   This study contributes to analyse the difference in the perception of
   EA, SC and SR among the people that eventually will stimulate the
   scientific reasoning among the governments, policymakers and scientists
   to develop a holistic framework to combat unprecedented event such as
   COVID-19 and ensure the authentication of sustainable environment and
   exceptional quality of life. The policymakers in Malaysia may use the
   findings of this study to inspect the social and environmental aspects

AB Since the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis that began in
   December 2019, many industries have been affected, including the
   franchise industry in Malaysia. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a
   great impact on business survival. Direct effects can be seen in reduced
   income, job losses, changes in customer preferences, and business
   relationships between franchisors and franchisees. Some franchises have
   had to close their operations, and others still struggled to survive
   during the pandemic crisis. In addressing this situation, the role of
   government is crucial in supporting the resilience of these franchisor
   entrepreneurs in an increasingly worrisome situation around the world.
   However, the existing literature that focuses on the role of government
   in developing countries such as Malaysia is still poorly understood. In
   addition, a study of the Malaysian franchising industry during the
   pandemic crisis is still inadequate, especially concerning the
   government's role in the survival of local franchises during the
   pandemic era. Therefore, understanding the role of the government in
   advocating the survival of local Malaysian franchises is worth studying.
   A qualitative research approach was applied through multiple cases
   involving twelve (12) franchise business owners and four (4)
   franchise-related agencies in Malaysia. In-depth interviews were
   conducted in exploring this topic. Thematic analysis has been used by
   applying "Atlas.ti" in analysing the data. Hence, the findings have
   indicated four themes from the grounded data. There are: (i) financial
   assistance; (ii) virtual franchise exhibition; (iii) training and
   support; and (iv) business development grants. This study is expected to
   highlight the role of government as well as agencies involved with the
   franchising industry in improving policies, strategies, and programs to
   ensure the viability of the franchise industry during periods of

AB Background The use of cosmetics is growing among both male and female
   consumers due to the availability of different brands. While there is an
   increase in the usage of cosmetic products, it is concerning whether the
   consumers are aware of the safety of the products.
   Aims This study aimed to widely explore consumers' perceptions and
   attitudes toward cosmetics within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among adults in
   Selangor, Malaysia. Thirty-three questions divided into three dimensions
   (socio-demographic parameters, assessment of perception, and assessment
   of attitude) were developed and validated to be answered by cosmetics
   consumers. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done
   using SPSS.
   Results A response rate of 87% was achieved, and the mean age of
   participants was 33 +/- 7.2. The overall perception of consumers
   indicates low levels of perception and moderate level of attitude toward
   cosmetic products. There was a positive correlation and high
   relationship between participants' perception and attitude (p = 0.001, r
   = 0.72). A significant association was observed between demographic data
   of respondents and their attitude and perception toward cosmetic
   products. Participants were unaware that sharing of cosmetic products
   could lead to bacterial infection and possibly increased the chance of
   contracting COVID-19.
   Conclusion This study displayed a nonchalant perception and attitude of
   Malaysian adults toward cosmetic products by focusing on aesthetics
   rather than health safety. Therefore, it is recommended to raise
   awareness on the composition and effects of cosmetic products, increase
   the practice of hygiene and dissuade the sharing of cosmetics to reduce
   transmissions of COVID-19.

   countries in the region to achieve economic growth. The Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI) has been proposed by China PDR in 2013 where some of
   Southeast Asian countries are the recipient of the investment projects
   including Malaysia and Indonesia. Together with Master Plan on ASEAN
   Connectivity (MPAC), both BRI and MPAC projects aim to improve physical
   connectivity, institutional connectivity and empowered people-to-people
   connectivity. This study examines how Malaysia and Indonesia have
   responded and participated in the BRI and MPAC in the aspect of their
   maritime connectivity and the development of related infrastructure. The
   early findings indicated that in comparison with Malaysia, Indonesia has
   been slow and cautious in embracing the BRI due to inefficiency in
   infrastructure development, various red tape and long-time anti-Chinese
   sentiments. The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has been
   going back since December 2019 has severely hindered the progress of the
   maritime connectivity projects in both countries.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an international public health
   emergency. As hospitals receive more severe forms of COVID-19 that
   necessitate resuscitation, emergency health care workers (HCW) must
   follow interim COVID-19 resuscitation guidelines. Objective: The aim is
   to evaluate the levels of knowledge, attitude, and practice among
   emergency HCW of the COVID-19 resuscitation protocol by the European
   Resuscitation Council (ERC). Methods: A cross-sectional study using a
   validated questionnaire was conducted among HCW in the emergency
   department of University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Malaysia from
   April to June 2021. Results: A total of 159 respondents were included in
   the analysis (89% response rate). Sixty-eight percent of respondents had
   adequate knowledge regarding COVID-19 resuscitation. Majority of the
   respondents had knowledge on airborne-precaution personal protective
   equipment (PPE) (99%) and infection control measures (98%). Nearly 73%
   were pessimistic about the COVID-19 prognosis. Seventy-three percent of
   respondents thought an arrested COVID-19 patient may benefit from
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and 94% were willing to administer
   CPR provided airborne-precaution PPE was available. Ninety percent of
   respondents re-ported adherence to resuscitation guidelines. There were
   significant differences in the mean knowledge scores between
   designation, education levels, and COVID-19 training. Overall, the
   respondents' level of practice was insufficient (27%), with a mean score
   of 53.7% (SD = 14.7). There was a lack of practice in the resuscitation
   of the intubated and patients who were being prone. There was
   insufficient practice about ventilation technique, use of supraglottic
   devices, and intubation barriers. There was a positive correlation
   between adequate knowledge and good practice. Conclusion: Emergency HCW
   have adequate knowledge, but poor compliance to the ERC COVID-19
   guidelines. Emergency HCW were willing and confident to resuscitate
   COVID-19 patients, despite fears of nosocomial infection and expectation
   of poor patients' prognosis. Ongoing education and training programs are
   recommended to improve their knowledge, cultivate a positive attitude,
   and achieve good compliance with COVID-19 resuscitation guidelines.

AB OBJECTIVES: Starting in March 2020, movement control measures were
   instituted across several phases in Malaysia to break the chain of
   transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we
   developed a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to
   examine the effects of the various phases of movement control measures
   on disease transmissibility and the trend of cases during the third wave
   of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia.METHODS: Three SEIR models were
   developed using the R programming software ODIN interface based on
   COVID-19 case data from September 1, 2020, to March 29, 2021. The models
   were validated and subsequently used to provide forecasts of daily cases
   from October 14, 2020, to March 29, 2021, based on 3 phases of movement
   control measures.RESULTS: We found that the reproduction rate (R value)
   of COVID-19 decreased by 59.1% from an initial high of 2.2 during the
   nationwide Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) to 0.9 during the
   Movement Control Order (MCO) and Conditional MCO (CMCO) phases. In
   addition, the observed cumulative and daily highest numbers of cases
   were much lower than the forecasted cumulative and daily highest numbers
   of cases (by 64.4-98.9% and 68.8-99.8%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The
   movement control measures progressively reduced the R value during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, more stringent movement control measures
   such as the MCO and CMCO were effective for further lowering the R value
   and case numbers during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in
   Malaysia due to their higher stringency than the nationwide RMCO.

AB Purpose: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has affected dental education
   in Malaysia. However, studies on dental students' knowledge, perception,
   and behaviors with regards to COVID-19 are very limited. Thus, this
   study aims to determine the knowledge status, perceived risk, and
   preventive behaviors of dental students in Malaysia regarding COVID-19.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among students from 13
   dental schools across Malaysia using online questionnaires. Results:
   From 355 respondents, 93.5% obtained a high score of knowledge of
   COVID-19. Female respondents scored higher than males in perceived risks
   and preventive behaviors. Chinese respondents scored highest in
   knowledge, while Malay respondents had the highest perceived risk score.
   The mean preventive behavior score did not vary across ethnicity.
   On-campus students scored higher in knowledge and perceived risk whereas
   off-campus students practiced more preventive behaviors. Clinical
   students' knowledge score was higher than preclinical students. Final
   year students scored higher in knowledge and perceived risk compared to
   their juniors. Conclusion: The majority of dental students have good
   knowledge and a high perceived risk of COVID-19, and they practiced most
   of the preventive behaviors. However, the latest information on this
   disease should be incorporated into dental schools' curriculums and
   updated periodically.

AB Purpose Orientation and Mobility (O&M) professionals teach people with
   low vision or blindness to use specialist assistive technologies to
   support confident travel, but many O&M clients now prefer a smartphone.
   This study aimed to investigate what technology O&M professionals in
   Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support their client
   work, to inform the development of O&M technologies and build capacity
   in the international O&M profession. Materials and Methods A technology
   survey was completed by professionals (n = 36) attending O&M workshops
   in Malaysia. A revised survey was completed online by O&M specialists (n
   = 31) primarily in Australia. Qualitative data about technology use came
   from conferences, workshops and interviews with O&M professionals.
   Descriptive statistics were analysed together with free-text data.
   Results Limited awareness of apps used by clients, unaffordability of
   devices, and inadequate technology training discouraged many O&M
   professionals from employing existing technologies in client programmes
   or for broader professional purposes. Professionals needed to learn
   smartphone accessibility features and travel-related apps, and ways to
   use technology during O&M client programmes, initial professional
   training, ongoing professional development and research. Conclusions
   Smartphones are now integral to travel with low vision or blindness and
   early-adopter O&M clients are the travel tech-experts. O&M professionals
   need better initial training and then regular upskilling in mainstream
   O&M technologies to expand clients' travel choices. COVID-19 has created
   an imperative for technology laggards to upskill for O&M tele-practice.
   O&M technology could support comprehensive O&M specialist training and
   practice in Malaysia, to better serve O&M clients with complex needs.

AB In Malaysia, the HPV immunization program has been introduced since 2010
   as part of the national immunization plan for female students aged 13
   years old. It was a very successful immunization program with good
   responses from students and parents until the start of COVID-19 pandemic
   in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the schools to be closed and
   resulted about 225000 female students aged 13 years old either missed
   their vaccination or have incomplete doses of HPV vaccination in 2020
   and 2021. This could possibly lead to an increase in cases of cervical
   cancer and genital warts in the upcoming years. Hence, a wellorganized
   catch-up HPV vaccination program is vital in ensuring the aim of
   achieving zero HPV-related infections in the future.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted schooling for children worldwide. Most
   vulnerable are non-citizen children without access to public education.
   This study aims to explore challenges faced in achieving education
   access for children of refugee and asylum-seekers, migrant workers,
   stateless and undocumented persons in Malaysia during the pandemic.
   In-depth interviews of 33 stakeholders were conducted from June 2020 to
   March 2021. Data were thematically analysed. Our findings suggest that
   lockdowns disproportionately impacted non-citizen households as
   employment, food and housing insecurity were compounded by xenophobia,
   exacerbating pre-existing inequities. School closures disrupted school
   meals and deprived children of social interaction needed for mental
   wellbeing. Many non-citizen children were unable to participate in
   online learning due to the scarcity of digital devices, and poor
   internet connectivity, parental support, and home learning environments.
   Teachers were forced to adapt to online learning and adopt alternative
   arrangements to ensure continuity of learning and prevent school
   dropouts. The lack of government oversight over learning centres meant
   that measures taken were not uniform. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an
   opportunity for the design of more inclusive national educational
   policies, by recognising and supporting informal learning centres, to
   ensure that no child is left behind.

AB Environments of human insecurity are a widespread problem in our
   globalised world, particularly for migrant workers, one of the most
   vulnerable groups in society today. These experiences of insecurity have
   been heightened in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
   article, we examine the collective experience of insecurity among
   migrant workers in Malaysia. In our analysis, we outline collective
   insecurity at two levels: the micro level of migrant workers' daily,
   subjective experiences of insecurity; and the macro level, in which
   insecurity is a consequence of structural forces, specifically the
   globalisation of labour. These two levels interact symbiotically,
   producing states of insecurity that are concretely experienced as
   anxiety and fear. Migrant workers in Malaysia also practice agency
   through small forms of resistance that they use to bolster one another
   and reduce their insecure experiences. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic
   and subsequent Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia, migrant workers
   have been further marginalised by the state, but they have also become
   connected to one another through acts of solidarity and resistance.
   However, the sustainability of these forms remains unclear.

AB Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was discovered in Wuhan, China in December
   2019, and has affected millions of lives worldwide. On 29th April 2020,
   Malaysia reported more than 5,000 COVID-19 cases; the second highest in
   the Southeast Asian region after Singapore. Recently, a forecasting
   model was developed to measure and predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia on
   daily basis for the next 10 days using previously-confirmed cases. A
   Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) is proposed by
   establishing L and ET parameters via several tests. The advantage of
   using this forecasting model is it would discriminate noise in a time
   series trend and produce significant forecasting results. The RF-SSA
   model assessment was based on the official COVID-19 data released by the
   World Health Organization (WHO) to predict daily confirmed cases between
   30th April and 31st May, 2020. These results revealed that parameter L =
   5 (T/20) for the RF-SSA model was indeed suitable for short-time series
   outbreak data, while the appropriate number of eigentriples was integral
   as it influenced the forecasting results. Evidently, the RF-SSA had
   over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This signifies the competence of
   RF-SSA in predicting the impending number of COVID-19 cases.
   Nonetheless, an enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should be developed for higher
   effectivity of capturing any extreme data changes.

AB Malaysian aquaculture sector consists of 391,000 t of cultivated
   organisms produced per year with an economic value for over USD 700
   million as estimated in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a large
   global human pandemic and it is currently ongoing, affecting profoundly
   Malaysian aquaculture, which is vital for seafood provision and security
   assurance. Thus, to increase our understanding about how the pandemic
   affects aqua culture sectors is crucial to design possible management
   measures both at local and national level. To do it, we designed a
   survey, starting in May 2020, consisting of 25 online questions to
   collect information about the impact of COVID-19 on the aquaculture
   sectors in Malaysia. A total of 105 respondents (2625 answered
   questions) was captured within the Movement Control Order (MCO) period
   and later extended to the Conditional MCO (CMCO). Almost 90 % of
   respondents was unanimous in answering that, and COVID-19 had a heavy
   effect on aquaculturerelated activities in Malaysia; 80 % of them
   indicated the market demand and logistic bottlenecks (72 %) as major
   constraints on their aquaculture activities. While the major option to
   solve aquaculture COVID-19 related issues was the use of online market
   or digital platforms (76 %), a large fraction of respondents requested
   for specific assistance to support aquaculture activities (e.g.
   financial support). Most respondents (93 %) was aware about the
   necessity of the Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) provided by the
   relevant agencies during the MCO / CMCO. Present data are crucial to
   develop policy measures both at national and international level to
   support seafood sectors under pandemic.

AB Background: Pre-existing comorbidities can predict severe disease
   requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission among COVID-19 cases. We
   compared comorbidities, clinical features and other predictive factors
   between COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission for
   intubation/mechanical ventilation and all other COVID-19 cases in
   Selangor, Malaysia.
   Method: Field data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Selangor,
   Malaysia, up to 13 April 2020 were used, comprising socio-demographic
   characteristics, comorbidities and presenting symptoms of COVID-19
   cases. ICU admission was determined from medical records. Multiple
   logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors
   associated with ICU admission requiring intubation/mechanical
   ventilation among COVID-19 cases.
   Results: A total of 1287 COVID-19-positive cases were included for
   analysis. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (15.5%) and
   diabetes (11.0%). More than one third of cases presented with fever
   (43.8%) or cough (37.1%). Of the 25 cases that required
   intubation/mechanical ventilation, 68.0% had hypertension, 88.0% had
   fever, 40.0% had dyspnoea and 44.0% were lethargic. Multivariate
   regression showed that cases that required intubation/mechanical
   ventilation had significantly higher odds of being older (aged >= 60
   years) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.9] and having hypertension (aOR =
   5.7), fever (aOR = 9.8), dyspnoea (aOR = 9.6) or lethargy (aOR = 7.9)
   than cases that did not require intubation/mechanical ventilation.
   Conclusion: The COVID-19 cases in Selangor, Malaysia requiring
   intubation/mechanical ventilation were significantly older, with a
   higher proportion of hypertension and symptoms of fever, dyspnoea and
   lethargy. These risk factors have been reported previously for severe
   COVID-19 cases, and highlight the role that ageing and underlying
   comorbidities play in severe outcomes to respiratory disease.

   declared the nationwide enforcement of the Movement Control Order to
   curb the spread of COVID-19. In September 2020, Malaysia entered the
   third wave of the outbreak. Active cases rose from 60 to more than
   13,000. The government's Ops Benteng stops illegal migrants, who are at
   high risk of bringing COVID-19 into Malaysia. This includes illegal
   Rohingya migrants, who enter Malaysia to flee persecution in their home
   country, Myanmar. There are approximately 150,000 Rohingya migrants in
   Malaysia and more are expected. This article examines the main reason
   behind the influx of Rohingya illegal migrants and discusses whether the
   Malaysian government should tighten its borders to safeguard against
   COVID-19. The government must prioritise its own citizens over the
   Rohingyas; the responsibility of managing this humanitarian disaster
   should be shared with other nations, particularly those party to the
   United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 1951.

   COVID-19 occupational transmission and subsequently, exposing patients
   and others. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and examine the
   characteristics and predictors of HCWs with COVID-19 infection in a
   Malaysian district. Methods: this is a crosssectional study of HCWs
   working at Cheras District Health Office, with COVID-19 infection from
   1st January to 31st October 2021. Data was obtained from the
   Occupational Safety and Health Unit which included variables of basic
   sociodemography, type of disease acquisition; healthcare-acquired (HA)
   or community-acquired (CA), and management outcome. Data was analysed
   descriptively and cases with type of disease acquisition were compared
   using logistic regression. Results: the prevalence of HCWs with COVID-19
   was 17.4%. Majority aged 30-39, female gender and Malay ethnicity
   (51.7%, 60% and 91.7% respectively). Main comorbidities included
   hypertension (3.3%), diabetes mellitus (3.3%), both hypertension and
   diabetes mellitus (2.5%) and obesity (4.2%). Smokers, pregnant mothers
   and non-immunized made up only small proportions (4.2%, 4.2%, and 4%
   respectively). Paramedics were the most infected proportion (68.4%).
   About one third of cases managed COVID-19 patients directly (37.5%).
   Similar proportion had HA infection (29.2%). Smaller proportion (12.8%)
   needed hospitalization. The early source of infection was HA
   (JanuaryApril). Later, the trend shifted towards CA (MayOctober). Male
   gender (OR 3.22, 95% CI = 1.43 - 7.29, p<0.05), smoker (OR 10.84, 95% CI
   = 1.17 - 100.77, p<0.05), and those who manage COVID-19 cases were more
   likely to acquire occupational COVID-19 infection (OR 2.28, 95% CI =
   1.02 - 5.09, p<0.05). Conclusion: continuous occupational infectious
   disease control measures is necessary to reduce the disease burden.
   Future research on HCWs with COVID-19 infection with larger scale is
   recommended to determine the final model for predictors of infection.

AB INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel pandemic that
   affects every other country in the world. Various countries have adopted
   control measures involving restriction of movement. Several studies have
   used mathematical modelling to predict the dynamic of this pandemic.
   Forecasting techniques can be used to predict the incidence cases for
   the short term. The study aims to forecast the COVID-19 incidence using
   the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method. MATERIALS
   AND METHODS: Using publicly available data, we performed a forecast of
   Malaysia COVID-19 new cases using Expert Modeler Method in SPSS and
   ARIMA model in R to predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. We compare 3
   different time frames based on different Movement Control Order (MCO)
   period. We compare the model fit and prediction across models. RESULTS:
   All models show static cases for each MCO 7-day prediction. For
   prediction until 12 May, the third MCO time frame shows the best model
   fit for both techniques. Both software shows a stationary trend of cases
   of below 100. CONCLUSION: These MCO models have shown to stabilize the
   rate of new cases. Further sub analysis and quality of data is needed to
   improve the accuracy of the model.

AB During disease outbreaks, women endure additional burdens associated
   with paid and unpaid work, often without consideration or the
   alleviation of other life responsibilities. This paper draws on the
   concept of the triple burden in theorizing the gender divisions in
   productive and reproductive work and community activities in the context
   of disaster. Events that include famine, war, natural disaster or
   disease outbreak are all well documented as increasing women's
   vulnerability to a worsening of gendered burdens. In the case of the
   Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, this is no different. Focussing on Sri
   Lanka, Malaysia, Vietnam and Australia, the four vignettes in this paper
   serve to highlight the intersections between Covid-19 and gendered
   burdens, particularly in frontline work, unpaid care work and community
   activities. While pre-disaster gender burdens are well established as
   strong, our analysis during the early months of the pandemic indicates
   that women's burdens are escalating. We estimate that women will endure
   a worsening of their burdens until the pandemic is well under control,
   and for a long time after. Public policy and health efforts have not
   sufficiently acknowledged the issues concerned with the associations
   between gender and disease outbreaks.

AB Shared decision making (SDM) activities in Malaysia began around 2010.
   The rise in the numbers of patients with chronic disease in Malaysia
   underscores a growing need for doctors to practice patient -centred care
   and SDM as more Malaysians come into regular contact with health
   decision-making scena-rios. Recent guidelines for medical
   professionalism have emphasized that options and risks be discussed in
   consultations, especially for procedures with risk of adverse outcomes.
   Although SDM is not legally required, principles of SDM are applied in
   legal judgements on informed consent. Research on SDM has grown to
   include the adoption of patient and public involvement in research, an
   increased emphasis on incorporating local cultural values in SDM, and
   implementation of SDM in Malaysia's health system and organizational
   culture. While COVID-19 hindered the progress of SDM research, one
   positive development was that vaccination choices heightened public
   consciousness about personal decisional autonomy and the need to discuss
   pros and cons with doctors before making a medical decision.

   exploring factors that motivate the crowds to sustain on the platform
   remains unclear, and very little literature was found on this matter.
   Lately, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world, including
   Malaysia. Due to the pandemic, many people have lost their jobs, and
   hence, most of them have shifted to digital work. Hence, to understand
   the motivation for continuous participation on the online crowdsourcing
   platform among low-income crowd workers (B40) in Malaysia, this paper
   explores the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for continuous
   participation. A qualitative method interview was performed where 14
   active participants of Upwork.com, under the GLOW program, took part
   during the data collection process. This paper used the thematic
   analysis method to extract the data collected from this study. The
   finding of this study identified eight intrinsic motivation factors: (1)
   personal development, (2) pastime, (3) fun, (4) passion, (5) task
   identity, (6) time-workplace flexibility, (7) altruistic, and (8) peers'
   success and four extrinsic factors: (1) monetary, (2) job security, (3)
   personal commitment, and (4) environment.

   800. Since then, MCO was extended several times and the latest phase of
   Recovery MCO (RMCO) will last until 31 August 2020. As seafood
   represents an important protein source, the aquaculture sector supports
   the livelihood of coastal communities in Malaysia, particularly those
   involved in microand small-scale fish farming activities. The emergence
   and spread of this pandemic severely disrupt market demand and supply
   chains of seafood industries. Therefore, this case report looks into the
   potential impacts of COVID-19 on the aquaculture sector of Malaysia.
   Then, the coping strategies implemented by Malaysia are highlighted and
   their potential effectiveness is discussed. Also, some useful
   recommendations are suggested to ensure the continuity and growth of the
   aquaculture sector. We believe that insights in this report are
   applicable to other sectors and countries with similar economic
   characteristics.

   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting orthopaedic surgeon in
   Malaysia in terms of exposure, general perceptions of risk, and the
   impact on their current and future practice. Methods: Orthopaedic
   surgeons nationwide were invited through email and text messages to
   answer an online self-administered questionnaire collecting demographic
   information, COVID-19 exposure experience, perception of risk, and
   impact on orthopaedic practice. Results: Of the respondents, 4.7% and
   14.0% were involved in frontline treatment for COVID-19 patients with
   non-orthopaedic and orthopaedic problem, respectively. Respondents
   working in Ministry of Health had highest percentage of involvement as
   frontliner, 7.8% (8/103) and 20.4% (21/103) for non- orthopaedic and
   orthopaedic related COVID-19 treatment, respectively (not significant).
   Their main concern was an infection of family members (125/235, 53.2%).
   Majority of respondents were still working (223/235, 94.9%), running
   outpatient clinics (168/223, 75.3%), and continued with their
   semi-emergency (190/223, 85.2%) and emergency surgeries (213/223,
   95.5%). Of the surgeons, 11.2% (25/223) did not screen their patients
   for COVID-19 prior to elective surgeries, 30.9% (69/223) did not have
   any training on proper handling of personal protective equipment (PPE),
   84.8% (189/223) make decision to manage more conservatively due to
   COVID-19 and 61.9% (138/ 223) had their income affected. Of the
   surgeons, 19.3% (43/223) started using telehealth facilities.
   Conclusion: Direct exposure to treatment of COVID-19 patients among the
   respondent is low and the main concern was infecting their family
   member. There are still several surgeons who did not conduct
   preoperative COVID-19 screening and practice without proper PPE
   training.

AB The evaluation of breakthrough infection and humoral immunity responses
   are important outcomes for vaccination policy for healthcare staff. This
   prospective cohort study collected blood samples at 5-time points;
   before primary vaccine doses, and at 2, 10 and 24 weeks after BNT162b2
   vaccination from 551 HCWs, between March and October 2021. We
   investigated the association between anti-spike-1 protein
   receptor-binding domain (anti-S1-RBD) antibody geometric mean titre
   (GMT) and breakthrough infections. Two weeks post-vaccination, the GMT
   of anti-S1-RBD antibodies was measured at almost maximum detectable
   value (3115 BAU/ml [95% CI, 3051-3180]); it decreased to 1486 BAU/ml
   (95% CI, 1371-1610) at 10 weeks; and to 315 BAU/ml (95% CI, 283-349) at
   24 weeks. Prior COVID-19 infection and age significantly affected the
   antibody titres. Fifty-six participants, none of whom were COVID-19
   convalescents, had breakthrough infections between 10 and 24 weeks
   post-vaccination. Before breakthrough infections, the GMT was not
   different between the breakthrough and non-breakthrough individuals.
   After infection, the GMT was significantly higher in individuals with
   breakthrough infections (2038 BAU/ml [95%CI, 1547-2685]), specifically
   in symptomatic breakthroughs, compared to those without infection (254
   BAU/ml [95%CI, 233-278]). A notable surge in breakthrough infections
   among healthcare workers coincided with the emergence of the Delta
   variant and when BNT162b2-elicited antibody responses waned in 10-24
   weeks (i.e. approximately 3-6 months). Post-breakthrough, the antibody
   response was boosted in individuals with symptomatic presentations, but
   not asymptomatic individuals. The study finding supports administering
   booster vaccination for healthcare staff, including those who recovered
   from asymptomatic breakthrough infection.

   involving 6,142,735 deaths worldwide as of 1 April 2022. This contagious
   disease has spread rapidly throughout the world, including Malaysia.
   Since the outbreak in Malaysia began in March 2020, the Movement Control
   Order (MCO) has been implemented nationwide, leaving a significant
   impact on its citizens, non-citizens, as well as refugees. There is some
   exploitation of refugees, where enforcement officers are targeting them
   for criminal offences. Stakeholders claimed the Malaysian government did
   not provide any assistance to refugees during the pandemic, including
   health care and economy. This article examines Malaysia's
   responsibilities as a host country to refugees during the Covid-19
   outbreak. The Malaysian government is proposed to continuously support
   refugees on humanitarian grounds based on the country's economic
   development capabilities. This paper will look into the current
   situation of the Refugees in Malaysia; discuss the challenges that the
   Refugees in Malaysia are facing; analyse the legal framework governing

AB The COVID-19 pandemic introduced significant novel risks for healthcare
   workers and healthcare services. This study aimed to determine the
   prevalence, trends, characteristics, and sources of COVID-19 infection
   among healthcare workers during the early COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysian
   hospitals. A cross-sectional study used secondary data collected from a
   COVID-19 surveillance system for healthcare workers between January and
   December 2020. Two surges in COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers in
   Malaysia were epidemiologically correlated to a similarly intense
   COVID-19 pattern of transmission in the community. The period prevalence
   of COVID-19 infection and the mortality rate among healthcare workers in
   Malaysia were 1.03% and 0.0019%, respectively. The majority of
   infections originated from the workplace (53.3%); a total of 36.3%
   occurred among staff; a total of 17.0% occurred between patients and
   staff; and 43.2% originated from the community. Healthcare workers had a
   2.9 times higher incidence risk ratio for the acquisition of COVID-19
   infection than the general population. Nursing professionals were the
   most highly infected occupational group (40.5%), followed by medical
   doctors and specialists (24.1%), and healthcare assistants (9.7%). The
   top three departments registering COVID-19 infections were the medical
   department (23.3%), the emergency department (17.7%), and hospital
   administration and governance (9.1%). Occupational safety and health
   units need to be vigilant for the early detection of a disease outbreak
   to prevent the avoidable spread of disease in high-risk settings. The
   transformation of some tertiary hospitals to dedicated COVID-19 care,
   the monitoring of new procedures for the management of COVID-19
   patients, and appropriate resource allocation are key to successful risk
   mitigation strategies.

   strategies to deal with anxiety caused by the pandemic and the effect of
   restriction of movement. Seeking social support and acceptance coping
   strategies were significantly associated with the level of anxiety. The

AB Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has a massive impact on economic growth

   four stages. Consequently, this situation has affected the stability and
   the relationship of stocks listed on Bursa Malaysia. Thus, this study is
   motivated to investigate and visualize a correlation of securities
   listed on FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI by employing a network analysis
   approach. The limitation of correlation analysis is that it only
   provides the strength and direction of the association, which is not
   visually shown in the graph. As a result, the network analysis technique
   is used to highlight the correlations between the stocks. The input of
   the network is based on the rate of return of each stock. The data is
   divided into two parts. The first duration is the period before
   implementation of MCO which is from 17th December 2020 to 17th March
   2020. The second duration is during four stages of MCO which cover from
   18th March 2020 to 3rd May 2020. There are changes in the
   interconnection between stocks in which seventeen stocks increased in
   the correlation measure during MCO. The importance of stocks is
   determined by applying centrality measures to disclose a topological
   structure of a network. This study finds that the stock with the highest
   connectivity based on the degree centrality before the MCO was unable to
   maintain the status as the central hub during the MCO. The results can
   assist the market participant to strategize the asset allocation to
   obtain well diversified portfolio. selection.

AB Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted
   in profound health challenges across the globe. Pharmacists' readiness
   to cope with the pandemic is critical in supporting and sustaining the
   healthcare workforce to meet the challenges. Objective This study aims
   to examine community pharmacists' views on their work environment,
   policies and preparedness for safe retail patronage to prevent the
   transmission of COVID-19 and assess the variables influencing coping
   strategies during the pandemic. Setting An online survey of pharmacists
   practising in community pharmacy setting in Malaysia. Method A
   questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in Malaysia to
   evaluate coping strategies of community pharmacists and pharmaceutical
   services provided during COVID-19 pandemic. Between May 1 and July 31,
   2020, the questionnaire was distributed to pharmacists working in
   community setting nationwide utilising a snowball sampling method. Main
   Outcome Measure Community pharmacists' perceptions on safety,
   resilience, organisational support, and pharmaceutical services offered
   during COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 217 pharmacists
   participated in the study. The vast majority of community pharmacists
   reported a positive outlook and were able to balance working with
   self-care during this period. Most reported to have access to personal
   protective equipment such as gloves and hand sanitisers. A large
   proportion of community pharmacies also installed physical barriers in
   doorways or in front of the counter, put markings on the ground to
   section areas to ensure physical distancing, and controlled the number
   of customers who could access the pharmacy during this period.
   Innovations reported to be implemented included teleconsultations and
   providing curb-side or drive-through delivery and pickup services.
   Conclusion The findings suggest the frontline and essential roles of
   community pharmacists in delivering pandemic responses, creating the
   opportunity to determine areas where community pharmacy services can be
   incorporated to strengthen the public health system and improve patient
   health outcomes.

   spatio-temporal contagion risk of the virus, ultimately, it seeks to
   test the hypothesis that higher population density results in
   exacerbated COVID-19 virulence in the community. The population density
   of 143 districts in Malaysia, as per data from Malaysia's 2010
   population census, was plotted against cumulative COVID-19 cases and
   infection rates of COVID-19 cases, which were obtained from Malaysia's
   Ministry of Health official website. The data of these three variables
   were collected between 19 January 2020 and 31 December 2020. Based on
   the observations, districts that have high population densities and are
   highly inter-connected with neighbouring districts, whether
   geographically, socio-economically, or infrastructurally, tend to
   experience spikes in COVID-19 cases within weeks of each other. Using a
   parametric approach of the Pearson correlation, population density was
   found to have a moderately strong relationship to cumulative COVID-19
   cases (p-value of 0.000 and R-2 of 0.415) and a weak relationship to
   COVID-19 infection rates (p-value of 0.005 and R-2 of 0.047).
   Consequently, we provide several non-pharmaceutical lessons, including
   urban planning strategies, as passive containment measures that may
   better support disease interventions against future contagious diseases.

AB Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread all over
   the world, causing unpredictable economic losses and public fear.
   Although vaccines against this virus have been developed and
   administered for months, many countries still suffer from secondary
   COVID-19 infections, including the United Kingdom, France, and Malaysia.
   Observations of COVID-19 infections in the United Kingdom and France and
   their governance measures showed a certain number of similarities. A
   further investigation of these countries' COVID-19 transmission patterns
   suggested that when a turning point appeared, the values of their
   stringency indices per population density (PSI) were nearly proportional
   to their absolute infection rate (AIR). To justify our assumptions, we
   developed a mathematical model named VSHR to predict the COVID-19
   turning point for Malaysia. VSHR was first trained on 30-day infection
   records prior to the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Belgium's
   known turning points. It was then transferred to Malaysian COVID-19 data
   to predict this nation's turning point. Given the estimated AIR
   parameter values in 5 days, we were now able to locate the turning
   point's appearance on June 2(nd), 2021. VSHR offered two improvements:
   (1) gathered countries into groups based on their SI patterns and (2)
   generated a model to identify the turning point for a target country
   within 5 days with 90% CI. Our research on COVID-19's turning point for
   a country is beneficial for governments and clinical systems against
   future COVID-19 infections.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has brought global health services to a
   standstill. National healthcare systems and medical staffing in many
   countries have reached crisis levels due to the phenomenal outbreak.
   Healthcare resources have been strained to meet the unprecedented
   numbers of patient admissions with a significant amount of funding and
   manpower being channelled towards tackling this global pandemic. Despite
   the rollout of vaccinations, the development of new viral strains has
   now presented a new challenge. With the inevitable conversion of
   tertiary public hospitals to specialized COVID-19 centres with 'Full
   Covid Status' and the mobilization of its doctors from all specialities
   to care for these patients, the non-COVID-19 patients are becoming more
   neglected. The lack of elective surgeries performed and non-emergent
   admissions due to the unavailability of beds and personnel to care for
   this group of patients are concerning. As most of the focus and
   resources are now aimed at COVID-19 patients, the need to forge
   collaborations and cooperation between hospitals, agencies and
   healthcare systems are pertinent to ensure the provision of quality
   treatment for those suffering from non-COVID-19 diseases. To highlight
   this effort in Malaysia, we would like to present 2 case studies of
   non-COVID-19 patients undergoing elective surgeries through
   intergovernmental ministerial collaborations and a public-private
   partnership.

AB The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in early 2020
   prompted a global lockdown from March to July 2020. Due to strict
   lockdown measures, many countries experienced economic downturns,
   negatively affecting many industries including energy, manufacturing,
   agriculture, finance, healthcare, food, education, tourism, and sports.
   Despite this, the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to
   observe the impacts of worldwide lockdown on global carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions and climate change. Being the main greenhouse gas responsible
   for rising global surface temperature, CO2 is released to the atmosphere
   primarily by burning fossil fuels. Compared to 2019, CO2 emissions for
   the world and Malaysia decreased significantly by 4.02% (-1365.83
   MtCO(2)) and 9.7% (-225.97 MtCO(2)) in 2020. However, this is
   insufficient to cause long-term impacts on global CO2 levels and climate
   change. Therefore, in this review, we explored the effects of worldwide
   lockdown on global CO2 levels, the impacts of national lockdown on
   Malaysia's CO2 emissions, and the influence of climate change in
   Malaysia.

   research used a sample of 188 non-financial firms from the Malaysian
   market for the years 2019-2020. We found that the COVID-19 has affected
   all firm characteristics including firm performance, governance
   structure, dividend, liquidity, and leverage level, yet, the difference
   between prior and post COVID-19 pandemic is not significant. Also, the
   investigation revealed that board size exerts a significant positive
   impact on firm performance. After splitting the sample based on year,
   however, we found that board size does not matter in the uncertain time
   of the current crisis, while board diversity appeared to be
   significantly enhancing firm performance in the crisis time compared to
   the prior year where it has an inverse association with firm performance
   in both indicators. Board meetings and audit committee meetings seemed
   to have a significant negative influence on firm performance pre and
   post-COVID-19. This study contributes to the limited literature by
   providing the first empirical evidence on the impact of Coronavirus on
   the firm performance and corporate governance association.

AB In this work, the optimization-based method is implemented to
   investigate the effectiveness of lockdown strategies undertaken to
   contain the COVID-19 during the first two waves in Malaysia. The
   well-known Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model was
   fitted to the actual data of infected cases from the official press to
   closely reflect the observed COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. The Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) were implemented to
   determine the daily transmission rate beta(t) that fits the SIR model to
   the actual data. The best fitness value of PSO is mostly stable at
   approximately 37.5 with the best value of 37.41 at a population size of
   1000, whilst the best value for GA slowly decreased to the best value of
   47.45 at a population size of 1000. In addition, PSO requires a lower
   number of iterations to reach the optimum fitness value for the same
   population size as compared to GA, while GA is too far to reach the
   convergence. As the removal rate (gamma) is a constant value fixed at
   0.1, the optimized beta(t) values indicate a high basic reproduction
   number (average R0 = 1.23) obtained before the Movement Control Order
   (MCO), followed by a considerable decrease to an average R0 value of
   1.23 during the MCO. During the Conditional MCO and Recovery MCO, the
   basic reproduction number was slightly decreased to an average R0 value
   less than 1. This is an indication of the success of the government to
   contain the pandemic during the first two waves as the R0 has been kept
   below than 1.

AB Introduction: During the second wave of the coronavirus disease 19
   (COVID-19) pandemic, Malaysia reported several COVID-19 clusters related
   to healthcare workers. Thus, addressing and understanding the risk of
   exposure in healthcare workers is important to prevent future infection
   and reduce secondary COVID-19 transmission within the healthcare
   settings. In this study, we aim to assess exposure and prevention
   practices against COVID-19 among healthcare workers at the Hospital
   Canselor Tuanku Muhriz, a university teaching hospital based in Kuala
   Lumpur, Malaysia. Methodology: A total of 571 healthcare workers at
   COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards as well as the emergency department and
   laboratory staff at COVID-19 testing labs were recruited. The presence
   of novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and IgM/IgG antibodies were
   confirmed in all healthcare workers. The healthcare workers responded to
   an online Google Forms questionnaire that evaluates demographic
   information and comorbidities, exposure and adherence to infection
   prevention and control measures against COVID-19. Descriptive analysis
   was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 24.0.
   Results: Three healthcare workers (0.5%) tested positive for SAR-CoV-2,
   while the remaining 568 (99.5%) were negative. All were negative for IgM
   and IgG antibodies during recruitment (day 1) and follow-up (day 15).
   More than 90% of the healthcare workers followed infection prevention
   and control practices recommendations regardless of whether they have
   been exposed to occupational risk for COVID-19. Conclusions: The
   healthcare workers' high level of adherence to infection prevention
   practices at this hospital helped reduce and minimize their occupational
   exposure to COVID-19.

   convenience sampling. A total of 330 valid questionnaires were analyzed
   using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and PROCESS for hypothesis
   testing. The study revealed a significant relationship involving food
   safety knowledge on personal attitude, perceived social pressure, and
   perceived autonomy. Moreover, organic food purchase intention was found
   to be influenced by personal attitude, perceived social pressure, and
   perceived autonomy. Interestingly, trust in organic food safety
   moderated the relationship between perceived autonomy and organic food
   purchase intention. The study proved valuable for stakeholders and
   organic food producers to understand the 'new normal' COVID-19 market
   scenario for a sound understanding of the market and the sustainability
   of the organic food industry. A new research framework is proposed and
   validated, related to individual purchase decision in global health

   web-based survey was conducted to obtain prevalence information on
   perceived depression, anxiety, and stress amongst stranded varsity
   students in the first 10 days of Malaysia's nationwide lockdown.
   Information on depression, anxiety and stress was compiled using
   Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. Fifty-eight stranded varsity
   students participated in this survey. The period of research was between
   the first 2 weeks of the initial MCO enforcement in Malaysia.
   Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the collected data. 14%, 22%
   and 10% of the 58 stranded students reported moderate to too severe
   levels of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. During this
   period, the most frequently utilised communication mode with family and
   loved ones was through phone calls, followed by WhatsApp calls and
   Facetime. Writing letters and telegram are the least used mode of
   communication amongst the respondents. Worrying about 'family safety'
   topped the list as a source of worry that was rated by 88% of the
   respondents, followed by 'interaction with others' and 'own safety'.
   Approximately 16% rated 'food and beverage' as a source of stress for
   them in the first 2 weeks of the lockdown. The government and varsities'
   coordinated initiatives and measures such as food aid and disseminating
   essential information by dedicated spokespeople may have softened the
   negative impact of a pandemic, isolation and uncertain situations on the

AB Since December 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic has been spreading all over
   the world. This epidemic has brought a risk of death in the daily
   activity (physical and social) participation that influences travellers'
   physical, social, and mental health. To analyze the impact of the
   COVID-19-induced daily activities on health parameters of higher
   education institutes, 150 students of the Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS,
   Perak, Malaysia, were surveyed through an online web survey using random
   sampling techniques. The data were analyzed through RStudio and SPSS
   using multilevel linear regression analysis and Hierarchical Structural
   Equation Modeling. The estimated results indicate that restricting
   individuals from doing out-of-home activities negatively influences
   physical and social health. A unit increase in the in-home maintenance
   activities during the COVID-19 pandemic introduced a daily increase of
   0.5% in physical health. Moreover, a unit increase in the in-home
   activities at leisure time represents a 1% positive improvement in
   social health. Thus, physical activity has proven to be beneficial in
   improving physical and social health with severe COVID-19. In contrast,
   the coefficient of determination (R-2) for all endogenous variables
   ranges from 0.148 to 0.227, which is incredibly acceptable in
   psychological research. For a healthier society with a better quality of
   life, this study adopted multidisciplinary approaches that are needed to

AB River water quality is a serious concern among scientist and government

   industrial discharge to rivers. The present study was conducted near the
   river mouth of the Kerian River to assess heavy metal pollution during
   COVID-19 pandemic-lockdown conditions and post-COVID-19 pandemic-unlock
   conditions. Twelve samples of shallow, middle, and bottom depths were
   collected at four locations along a 9.6 km reach. A concentration of
   eight heavy metals including Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Manganese,
   Nickel, Lead, and Zinc were extracted through atomic absorption
   spectrometry. Total suspended solid was measured during laboratory
   experimentation. The results showed that, during the pandemic,
   concentrations of Nickel, Zinc, and Iron were high at shallow, middle,
   and bottom depths, respectively. Decreasing orders of heavy metal
   concentration are variable at different depths due to either their high
   sinking tendency with other existing components of water matrix or the
   anthropogenic source. However, almost all values of heavy metals are

TI Rickets Due to Severe Vitamin D and Calcium Deficiency During the
   COVID-19 Pandemic in Malaysia

AB Objective: Challenging differential diagnosis
   Background: Rickets is the deficiency in mineralization of the bone
   associated with lack of sunlight exposure and inadequate dietary calcium
   and/or vitamin D in children. Important efforts to eradicate rickets
   include appropriate sunlight exposure advice and fortification of food
   and milk with vitamin D. However, there is a growing concern that the
   current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will increase the
   incidence of rickets due to inadequate sunlight exposure resulting from
   movement restriction measures imposed by governments across the world.
   Case Report: A 22-month-old girl presented to our primary care clinic in
   Selangor, Malaysia with abnormal gait and bowing of the legs during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. She had a history of inadequate sun exposure as she
   lived in an apartment and there was a Movement Control Order in place
   because of the pandemic. Calcium intake was also poor as she could not
   tolerate formula milk and did not consume any other dairy products.
   Investigations revealed severe hypocalcemia and low vitamin D level. She
   was diagnosed with nutritional rickets and was referred for admission to
   correct the hypocalcemia. She was subsequently discharged with oral
   calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Her calcium and vitamin D levels
   improved and at her 6-month review, her bilateral bowed legs had
   improved significantly.
   Conclusions: This case highlights the importance of having a high degree
   of suspicion for vitamin D deficiency and rickets in young children
   growing up during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health messages on
   preventing the spread of COVID-19 should also be interlaced with
   messages addressing the possible effects of our new norms such as
   inadequate sunlight exposure.

AB The importance of lifelong learning is an indisputable fact both for the
   development of a knowledge society and for personal development. It is
   essential and has been regarded as a learning outcome in engineering
   courses. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a massive
   shift in the higher education landscape. The migration to online
   learning poses questions on whether students can cope with the sudden
   transition in learning from the perspective of lifelong learning skills.
   Hence, this study aimed to investigate the characteristics of lifelong
   learning competencies and factors affecting lifelong learning among
   chemical engineering students at Monash University Malaysia during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed-methods study (questionnaires and interviews)
   was conducted to address the research questions. Forty-two percent of
   the students completed the questionnaires voluntarily. Among these, six
   students were randomly selected for the interviews. The questionnaires
   of the lifelong learning scale and factor scale were adopted from the
   existing literature. Statistical analyses (ANOVA, t-test, and multiple
   linear regression) were used to analyse the differences based on gender
   and level of study and the correlation between the two scales. Thematic
   analysis was employed to analyse the interview scripts and support the
   quantitative analysis. The results showed that awareness, gender, and
   level of study do not affect lifelong learning competencies. Factors
   such as curiosity and openness to learning have affected the chemical
   engineering students' lifelong learning competencies during the
   pandemic. Higher education should undertake to elicit curiosity and
   openness to learning among students to increase their propensity for
   lifelong learning.

AB The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic since its onset
   has had a dramatic and often devastating impact, both physical and
   psychological, on all healthcare workers. This study aimed to assess the
   impact of psychological distress that COVID-19 has on nurses, as well as
   the coping strategies that they employed. This is a cross-sectional
   national online survey. A total of 859 nurses actively involved in
   caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Malaysia
   participated in the study. More than three-quarters of the nurses
   experienced stress (77.2%). A total of 88.7% and 7.2% of nurses revealed
   a moderate and high stress level, respectively. Approximately one in
   eight (12.1%) nurses reported feeling depressed. Nurses working in the
   outpatient departments reported significantly higher stress levels than
   nurses working in inpatient care departments. Nurses having chronic
   health problems reported significantly higher depression levels than
   nurses with no chronic health problem. Highly stressed or depressed
   nurses tend to adopt avoidance coping strategies while religion and
   emotional support were used regardless of the stress or depression
   levels experienced. The findings of the study provide insight into the
   mental health and coping strategies of nurses actively involved in
   caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Malaysia.
   This would be of tremendous help to nursing administrators in
   implementing mental health services for nurses during and following the

AB The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of the teaching
   strategies used by lecturers in Indonesia and Malaysia during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Many lecturers must consider the amount of teaching
   they can provide. The transition from offline to online learning, which
   is accompanied by extensive technological use, is extremely challenging.
   A survey study was designed using an online questionnaire. The
   questionnaire is including items on learning objectives, lesson
   materials, teaching and learning activities, learning design, media,
   resources, and learning evaluations. A Google form-based online
   questionnaire is used to collect the data. The research participants are
   TVET lecturers from two universities in Indonesia and Malaysia with 200
   valid responses. Descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution,
   mean, and standard deviation are used to analyse the research data.
   Inferential statistics, t-test is used to investigate the difference
   between two countries, Malaysia and Indonesia on the teaching strategies
   during the pandemic. The results show that Indonesian and Malaysian
   lecturers have similar preferences for lesson material, learning
   resources, teaching and learning activities. While learning objectives,
   learning design, media, and learning evaluation are all distinct and
   interconnected. Most Malaysian lecturers agree that online learning
   allows for greater teaching flexibility, more caring, and is more open
   to meet the needs of students. Other than that, the t-test show no
   difference in teaching strategies between Malaysia and Indonesia. For
   the conclusion, lecturers at both universities adapt quickly to the
   changes that occur during each phase of the pandemic. The most effective
   teaching strategies are presented to ensure that educational services
   and processes continue to perform.

AB Background. The outbreak of Coronavirus-19 or COVID-19 has detrimental
   effects on the sports industry. Cancellation of sports training and
   competitions, movement restriction, and social isolation present an
   emotional challenge for athletes. Objectives. This cross-sectional study
   examined the prevalence of emotional distress among athletes during the
   MCO of Covid-19 in Malaysia Methods. 224 male and 264 female athletes
   participated in this study in May 2020. The majority of the participants
   were archers (20.7%), followed by athletics (12.9), netball (8.4%), and
   badminton (6.6%). An online survey was employed, which consists of three
   measures: (a) demographic information, (b) Depression, Anxiety and
   Stress Scale -21, and (c) Kessler Psychological Distress Scale - 10.
   Results. The results indicated that 7.2% (N=35) of the participants
   reported severe to extremely severe stress, 20.5% (N=100) of
   participants experienced severe to extremely severe anxiety, and 10%
   (N=49) participants reported severe to extremely severe depression.
   Moreover, Chi-Square analysis revealed no significant differences
   between the level of stress, anxiety, and depression based on age,
   gender, and category of sports (individual vs. team sports), except for
   gender and depression (X-2 (4, N=488) = 12.18, P= 0.016). More female
   athletes reported severe depression (20.3%) compared to male athletes
   (13.4%). Conclusion. This finding suggests further assessment,
   monitoring, and treatment plan for athletes, especially female athletes,
   to ensure their mental health and emotional wellbeing during this
   Covid-19 pandemic.

AB The tourism sector is expected to continue experiencing a significant
   increase in tourist arrivals. Meanwhile, the labour requirement
   especially in the tourism sub-sector has been anticipated to increase.
   However, the Covid-19 outbreak has interrupted the number of tourist
   arrivals to Malaysia. Tourism sector's receipt and the labour
   requirement will also be affected. The objective of this study is to
   forecast the labour requirements in the tourism sector in Malaysia. This
   study provides an initial overview of the labour requirements including
   during the Covid-19 outbreak which occurred in 2020. The method used in
   this study was the Input-Output method. The labour requirements were
   projected for three years, i.e. 2017, 2019 and 2020. Projections were
   also made based on a 25 percent decrease in Chinese tourist spending in
   Malaysia. The results showed that the labour requirements in 2017, 2019
   and 2020 increased by 2.6 million people, 2.8 million people and 3.0
   million people, respectively. However, when there was a decline in
   Chinese tourist spending, the labour requirement was 2.6 million people
   indicating a drop by -11.40 percent. The entertainment and recreation
   services were the most affected sectors when the Covid-19 outbreak
   occurred, at a rate of -66.31 percent. Discussions elaborated on the
   importance of labour requirements estimation in the tourism industry in
   response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Implications of the study are also

AB Background: Restrictive orders and temporary programmatic or ad hoc
   changes within healthcare and other supportive systems that were
   implemented in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia may have
   created hindrances to accessing healthcare and/or receiving other
   supportive services for people who use drugs (PWUDs).
   Design: A primarily qualitative study has been conducted to evaluate how
   service providers and recipients were adapting and coping during the
   initial periods of the COVID-19 response.
   Settings: The study engaged several healthcare and non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) in the peninsular states of Penang, Kelantan,
   Selangor, and Melaka.
   Participants: Medical personnel of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT)
   programs (n = 2) and HIV clinics (n = 3), staff of NGO services (n = 4),
   and MMT patients (n = 9) were interviewed using a semi-structured
   format.
   Results: Interviewed participants reported significant organizational,
   programmatic, and treatment protocols related changes implemented within
   the healthcare and support services in addition to nationally imposed
   Movement Control Orders (MCOs). Changes aimed to reduce patient flow and
   concentration at the on-site services locations, including less frequent
   in-person visits, increased use of telemedicine resources, and greater
   reliance on telecommunication methods to maintain contacts with patients
   and clients; changes in medication dispensing protocols, including
   increased take-home doses and relaxed rules for obtaining them, or
   delivery of medications to patients' homes or locations near their homes
   were reported by the majority of study participants. No significant
   rates of COVID-19 infections among PWUDs, including among those with HIV
   have been reported at the study sites.
   Conclusions: Although the reported changes presented new challenges for
   both services providers and recipients and resulted in some degree of
   initial disruption, generally, all participants reported successful
   implementation and high levels of compliance with the newly introduced
   restrictions, regulations, and protocols, resulting in relatively low
   rates of treatment disruption or discontinuation at the study sites.

AB Human emotion is often a reflection of one's behaviour that leads to
   awareness of one's mental health. Emotion detection on Twitter users
   specifically gains attention as it generates information that is useful
   in the field of psychology and linguistics. However, most existing works
   related to the subject analysed the emotion of a tweet based on the
   number of keywords or phrases in it, thus resulting in false annotations
   and eventually false judgement of the user's emotion. This paper
   proposes a two-step model with high and reliable accuracy to detect the
   emotion of Twitter users based on the semantic meaning of the tweets
   they posted. The first step classified the emotion of each tweet using
   four different deep learning techniques. The second step detected the
   emotion of the user based on the proposed statistical post-level
   features and a boosting technique. Then, Kappa's agreement score method
   was implemented to validate both models. The first step achieved 0.9482
   in accuracy while the second step achieved 0.9683 in accuracy. To
   further validate such highly accurate result, a case study was
   conducted, and a web-based system was developed to analyse the emotion
   of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our
   analysis corresponded to most of the current reports on the pandemic
   which further proved the reliability of the developed model.

AB This paper attempts to throw light on the concept of 'othering'
   previously framed through the prism of identity politics. As COVID-19
   continues to ravage our economy and social life, we turn to looking at
   two contested sites of the highland national borders and the urban
   cities to understand how the 'othering' idea manifests itself right when
   the pandemic began in late December 2019. The first situation is
   described in social media as Malaysia's mass rage and xenophobic rants
   against Rohingya refugees and the second scenario is the closure of
   international borders between Sarawak and East Kalimantan in the uplands
   located in the northeast of Central Borneo. By analysing texts in the
   form of narratives, anecdotes and communication encountered through
   social media, the paper raised questions whether these were
   manifestations of specific forms of marginalisation of people based on
   perceived group differences or simply expressions of fear of COVID-19
   disease and anxiety about scarcity of resources as a result of the
   pandemic.

   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the COVID-19
   outbreak by using a self-administered questionnaire. The instrument used
   was adopted from the World Health Organization resources. Descriptive
   statistics were used to describe the categorical data. Chi-square and
   independent t-test were performed to evaluate the associations between
   the variables and preventive behaviors.
   Results: A total of 465 (97.3%) respondents were recorded. The mean age
   was 34.3 +/- 11.8 years old. A high percentage of the respondents
   (99.4%) were aware of the COVID-19 outbreak, and their knowledge mean
   score was 18.74 (Standard Deviation [SD]: 2.51). The mean scores of
   self-efficacy, barriers, and drivers were 11.07 (SD: 1.72), 5.20 (SD:
   2.81), and 39.71 (SD: 5.17), respectively. Barriers (Odds Ratio [OR]:
   1.10; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.21; p < 0.05) and drivers
   (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.17; p < 0.001) were found to be predictors
   for social distancing practices.
   Conclusions: Knowledge and self-efficacy were found to be at good
   levels, whereas self-efficacy, barriers, and drivers were revealed to be
   the predictive factors in determining the preventive behaviors.
   Adherence to preventive measures was largely affected by the behavioral
   drivers.

AB The world had witnessed the various positive environmental implications
   of nationwide during movement control orders (MCO) brought upon by
   COVID-19, such as the quality of clean rivers and air. However, these
   situations are not the same with solid waste management contexts,
   especially the generation of food waste, plastics, and clinical waste.
   This study examined the research gap by conducting research based on the
   implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for solid waste generation during
   MCO and the month of Ramadan in Malaysia. This study used the data
   related to solid waste generation, which was collected from SWCorp and
   for the COVID-19 cases, the data was collected from the Ministry of
   Health Malaysia. The data of solid waste generated were collected from
   January 1st to June 4th at the landfill of 8 states. According to SWCorp
   data, the trend of solid waste generation during MCO (average 6,601,72
   tan metric/day) is lower than before MCO (average 7,566.05 tan
   metric/day) and during Ramadan (average 6,745.19 tan metric/day). The
   trend of declining solid waste generation from the industrial sector has
   drastically decreased; however, domestic solid waste among households
   has continued to increase at a moderate rate. This study provides
   information on the amount of solid waste generation in Peninsular
   Malaysia, especially during the pandemic COVID-19, where it provides the
   guideline for stakeholders to take relevant strategies towards reducing
   solid waste generation during and after pandemic COVID-19.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic affected how we spend our time in the workplace
   and at home. Moreover, it caused employed couples to simultaneously work
   from home and deal with unpaid work due to Malaysia's Movement Control
   Order (MCO). What happens to housework and childcare responsibilities
   when women and men are required to work from home due to an abrupt
   lockdown? Who is doing the housework and childcare? Who should be
   responsible for unpaid domestic work? What are the factors that affect
   men's share in housework and childcare'? This paper reports the early
   results of an online survey conducted on Malaysian men and women during
   the nationwide imposed lockdown in May 2020. In addition, it discusses
   how the pandemic affected unpaid housework and childcare time and
   responsibilities in Malaysia. The findings suggest that women spend more
   time on housework and childcare than men and are responsible for most
   unpaid domestic work during COVID-19. These findings are consistent with
   those obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also suggest
   that the time availability perspective affects men's share in housework
   and that the relative resources perspective affects their share in
   childcare during COVID-l9. Overall, the results call for policy
   attention to the factors that narrow gender inequality in unpaid
   domestic work.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the perception of
   health-care students on the recent COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. There
   was one study by Caliskhan et al. (2020) conducted among Turkish
   final-year medical students showed that the students were knowledgeable
   about and aware of the COVID-19 pandemic. To the authors' knowledge,
   there are limited number of studies conducted among health-care students
   in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach The online questionnaire was
   randomly distributed to the health-care students in Malaysia. The
   questionnaire consists of socio-demographic data and perceptions on
   COVID-19. Descriptive analysis was used to analyse the perceptions of
   the health-care students on COVID-19. Findings Health-care students in
   Malaysia have positive perceptions on COVID-19, and it did not give huge
   impact of their interest in this health-care field. Thus, it is
   important that this issue is investigated, and the perceptions of
   health-care students on COVID-19 can be highlighted. Research
   limitations/implications The strength of this study was the
   participation from the health-care students from various institutions,
   which have different experience and backgrounds. The study was limited
   on the items of question utilised. Due to the limited time and urgency
   of the survey, the authors were unable to study their knowledge,
   attitudes and way they are going to cope with this kind of pandemic as
   the students and as future health-care workers. Originality/value The
   paper points out the effect on the recent COVID-19 pandemic on
   health-care students in Malaysia. It also points out the perceptions of
   health-care students in Malaysia on the current pandemic. It is expected
   that the results of this research would serve as baseline data for
   health-care institutions in Malaysia to continue equip the future front
   liners that can adapt future challenges.

   teachers' online teaching competence and ability in two higher education
   (HE) institutions in Sarawak, Malaysia. The study employs the validated
   Faculty Readiness to Teach Online (FRTO) instrument which assesses four
   online teaching competencies: Course Design, Course Communication, Time
   Management, and Technical Competence, to gather data. The findings from
   156 respondents revealed that Course Design was rated highest for online
   teaching competence and ability, followed by Course Communication, Time
   Management, and Technical Competence. A multivariate analysis of
   variance, MANOVA, was conducted to examine whether demographic variables
   made a difference in teachers' perceived importance and ability. All
   demographic variables did not influence the perceived importance of
   online teaching competence and ability. Further analysis from the t-test
   revealed no significant variation between the perceived importance of
   online teaching competence and ability. The findings highlight
   opportunities for strategic orientation to change during crisis. Further
   qualitative and longitudinal research among more HE institutions is
   needed to uncover whether such perceptions were articulated into online
   teaching practices. Implications for pedagogy and policy are discussed.

AB Malaysia is currently facing an outbreak of COVID-19. We aim to present
   the first study in Malaysia to report the reproduction numbers and
   develop a mathematical model forecasting COVID-19 transmission by
   including isolation, quarantine, and movement control measures. We
   utilized a susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) model
   by incorporating isolation, quarantine, and movement control order (MCO)
   taken in Malaysia. The simulations were fitted into the Malaysian
   COVID-19 active case numbers, allowing approximation of parameters
   consisting of probability of transmission per contact (beta), average
   number of contacts per day per case (zeta), and proportion of
   close-contact traced per day (q). The effective reproduction number
   (R-t) was also determined through this model. Our model calibration
   estimated that (beta), (zeta), and (q) were 0.052, 25 persons, and 0.23,
   respectively. The (R-t) was estimated to be 1.68. MCO measures reduce
   the peak number of active COVID-19 cases by 99.1% and reduce (zeta) from
   25 (pre-MCO) to 7 (during MCO). The flattening of the epidemic curve was
   also observed with the implementation of these control measures. We
   conclude that isolation, quarantine, and MCO measures are essential to
   break the transmission of COVID-19 in Malaysia.

AB Purpose This study aims to examine how demographic and psychological
   predictors of free and paid vaccine acceptance operate within an
   infectious environment. The psychological predictors were derived from
   the protection motivation theory (PMT), including the appraised
   effectiveness of vaccine in containing the pandemic and the fear of
   COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach A representative data set that
   consists of responses from 2,850 Malaysians was used in this study.
   Multi-level modelling was used to analyse the data. Findings Results
   indicated that the acceptance of free and paid vaccination did not
   differ by region. This suggests that the effects of the included
   psychological predictors on vaccine acceptance are independent from the
   environment. Malaysians are more likely to endorse both free and paid
   vaccination when it is perceived as effective in controlling the
   pandemic. When the vaccine is deemed as an effective preventive of
   COVID-19, Malaysians tend to seek free vaccination. Although fear of
   COVID-19 did significantly predict the endorsement of vaccination, it is
   a weaker predictor than the perceived effectiveness of vaccine.
   Originality/value This research used a large representative data set and
   the PMT framework in addressing vaccine acceptance in Malaysia.

AB Malaysia implemented its first Movement Control Order (MCO) during the
   early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to slow the transmission of the
   virus. This study aimed to explore the public perception of the MCO
   implementation and people's experiences during this period. The study
   employed qualitative explorative in-depth interviews conducted with 23
   Malaysian adults from various demographic backgrounds. Thematic analysis
   was performed using NVivo 12. Three main themes were identified: a
   period of information surge, heterogeneous emotional response, and
   attempts to adapt. During the MCO, the participants obtained information
   from multiple platforms. They suggested the need for clear and repeated
   instructions to avoid confusion and misinformation. They also
   acknowledged the importance of the MCO in breaking the chain of
   transmission and safeguarding high-risk groups; however, they also
   expressed that stricter enforcement from the authorities was warranted.
   The changes in the participants' work-life routines, lack of physical
   interaction, and uncertainty about their health and the economy due to
   the MCO negatively impacted their psychological states. Despite these
   challenges, the participants attempted to adapt to life under the MCO in
   different ways. The findings imply that during a crisis, the public
   tends to seek clear and reliable information, experience emotional
   turmoil, and adapt to changes. The MCO implementation can be improved
   through an effective communication strategy and efforts to battle
   misinformation.

AB (1) Background: The teaching profession has become more challenging due
   to the increased use of information technology, which potentially
   increases psychological distress among teachers. This study aimed to
   determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among school
   teachers in Malaysia during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and its
   associated sociodemographic factors. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional
   study was conducted among primary and secondary school teachers in
   Malaysia. A validated DASS-21 questionnaire was used for mental health
   screening, and the study was conducted online during the pandemic
   period. (3) Results: The percentages of respondents with mild, moderate,
   severe, and extremely severe depression were 12%, 9.7%, 4.7%, and 3.1%,
   respectively. Those with mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe
   anxiety accounted for 11.5%, 12.3%, 6.3%, and 6%, respectively. Those
   with mild, moderate, severe, and very severe stress accounted for 12.8%,
   12%, 5.3%, and 2.5%, respectively. Perceived overworking was
   significantly greater during the pandemic compared to before the
   pandemic. Significant experience in teaching, and less perceived
   overworking before and during the pandemic were associated with better
   mental health. (4) Conclusions: Periodic mental health screening for
   teachers may be beneficial in preventing mental health disorders and
   improving the quality of student education. A full assessment and
   innovation of the curriculum and workload should be implemented.

AB Equity crowdfunding (ECF), also known as crowd-investing or investment
   crowdfunding, is a way of boosting capital used by start-ups and
   early-stage companies. Fundamentally, ECF offers the company's
   securities to potential investors in exchange for their investment. As a
   result, each investor is authorized to a share in the company
   proportionate to their financing. This paper discusses the ECF industry
   regulations in Malaysia and Indonesia in terms of its prospects and
   challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic through doctrinal research using
   the conventional legal method. Critical and analytical approaches were
   used to achieve its objectives. The findings showed that ECF has seen a
   growth of over 170 percent in new accounts registered in Malaysia, with
   65 percent of them being retail investors. There is a great demand from
   individual and retail investors who are looking to invest in various
   investment products and services made accessible to them. The Capital
   Markets and Services Act 2007 plays an important role to provide good
   governance of ECF business in Malaysia. Further, the Guidelines on
   Recognized Markets (GRM 2020) (Item 1.01 GRM) and section 15 (g) of the
   Securities Commission Act 1993 clarifies the function of the Securities
   Commission to regulate ECF activities and protect the interests of the
   parties involved, especially investors. In Indonesia, the main regulator
   of ECF is the Financial Services Authority and the new ECF law is the
   Financial Services Authority Regulation Number 57/ POJK.04/2020
   concerning Securities Crowdfunding. The regulation aims to extend the
   scope of the crowdfunding which includes debt -based securities and
   sukuk. The prospects of ECF business in both countries are great
   especially in the era of the pandemic because the fintech, which has led
   to new investment products and services, is a vital force that helps
   democratize investments and will continue to increase as investors
   become more educated and informed. In terms of the ECF law,
   comparatively, it is different in terms of the governance, process and
   procedure, types of investors, etc. which are applicable in both
   Malaysia and Indonesia.

AB Background: Rapid population aging occurring in developing nations
   necessitates innovation to ensure we continue to gain ground on aging
   research despite pandemic threats. While developed nations have resorted
   to virtual communications, this is challenging in developing nations due
   to poor internet connectivity and digital literacy. Objectives: The aim
   of this study was to determine the feasibility of virtual data
   collection for a longitudinal study of aging assessing cognitive frailty
   in a middle-income Southeast Asian country. Methods: The Transforming
   Cognitive Frailty into Later-Life Self-Sufficiency (AGELESS)
   longitudinal study of aging involved community-dwelling participants
   aged 60 years and above. A semi-structured focus group discussion was
   conducted via videoconferencing with selected representatives from
   existing participants. The survey instrument was compiled during a
   hybrid meeting and refined using a virtual Delphi process involving 51
   AGELESS investigators. The final draft survey and recruitment strategy
   were then piloted among selected participants. Results: Twelve
   individuals participated in the virtual focus group interview.
   Smartphone, tablet computer, laptops, and desktop personal computers
   were used for information gathering, communication, banking, shopping,
   leisure, religion, and education, within this group. The survey
   instrument was redacted from 362 items in 18 sections to 141 items in 12
   sections through 3 virtual Delphi rounds facilitated by email, social
   media messaging, and videoconferencing which attracted 213 comments. Of
   45 participants selected for the pilot survey, 30 were successfully
   contacted after one attempt and 18 completed the survey. Cognitive

AB Remote work (working from home) became a norm rather than an exception
   for the global workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, influencing every
   facet of life in both positive and negative ways. The stringent action
   of the Malaysian government in enacting the Movement Control Order (MCO)
   motivated the investigation of its impact on the energy consumption
   behaviour of working people regarding air conditioner (AC) use. To this
   end, this study conducted a cross-sectional survey through an online
   platform. An ordinal logistic regression model (ORL) was used to analyse
   the collected data of 1873 respondents to determine the factors
   influencing the ordinal variable of interest, AC-usage behaviour during
   remote work. Next, the variable with unordered categories, the
   MCO-induced change in AC-usage behaviour, was analysed using a
   multinomial regression model (MLT) to identify the potential
   determinants. Finally, a reason analysis unveiled aspects behind the
   transition in AC use during remote work. This study identified stopping
   AC use during remote work despite using it at the office before the MCO
   period as the most significant change in AC-usage behaviour due to MCO.
   This change was frequently adopted by people with medium-level incomes
   and high electricity bills. By contrast, participants unfamiliar with
   their electricity bill were most likely to start AC use during remote
   work, although they did not use it before the MCO. Participants working
   remotely in the communal spaces of their houses preferred to stop using
   ACs during MCO compared to private room users. Furthermore, age group
   and ethnicity significantly influenced AC-usage behaviour in remote work
   and changes in such demeanours. These findings recommend policy
   interventions to expedite limited AC use for a sustainable energy
   sector, even during future climatic emergencies .(c) 2022 Institution of

AB In this paper, new model on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with
   four compartments including susceptible, exposed, infected, and
   recovered class with fractal-fractional derivative is proposed. Here,
   Banach and Leray-Schauder alternative type theorems are used to
   establish some appropriate conditions for the existence and uniqueness
   of the solution. Also, stability is needed in respect of the numerical
   solution. Therefore, Ulam-Hyers stability using nonlinear functional
   analysis is used for the proposed model. Moreover, the numerical
   simulation using the technique of fundamental theorem of fractional
   calculus and the two-step Lagrange polynomial known as fractional
   Adams-Bashforth (AB) method is proposed. The obtained results are tested
   on real data of COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia from 25 January till 10
   May 2020. The numerical simulation of the proposed model has performed
   in terms of graphs for different fractional-order q and fractal
   dimensions p via number of considered days of disease spread in
   Malaysia. Since COVID-19 transmits rapidly, perhaps, the clear
   understanding of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is important for
   countries to implement suitable strategies and restrictions such as
   Movement Control Order (MCO) by the Malaysian government, against the
   disease spread. The simulated results of the presented model demonstrate
   that movement control order has a great impact on the transmission
   dynamics of disease outbreak in Malaysia. It can be concluded that by
   adopting precautionary measures as restrictions on individual movement
   the transmission of the disease in society is reduced. In addition, for
   such type of dynamical study, fractal-fractional calculus tools may be
   used as powerful tools to understand and predict the global dynamics of
   the mentioned disease in other countries as well.

AB Monitoring public psychological and behavioural responses during the
   early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is
   important for the management and control of infection. This study aims
   to investigate the temporal trend in (1) avoidance and protective
   behaviors, (2) fear, (3) socio-economic impact, and (4) anxiety levels
   during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a high level of
   anxiety may have a detrimental impact during an infectious disease
   outbreak, factors associated with anxiety were also explored. The survey
   was carried out for 10 weeks and the responses were divided into three
   periods of around 3 weeks: 25 January-21 February, 22 February-17 March
   and 18 March-3 April (the period the Malaysian Government issued
   Movement Control Order). Findings revealed that most of the
   pyschobehavioural variables showed small increases during first (25
   January-21 February) and second (22 February-17 March) periods, and high
   psychobehavioral responses were reported during the third period. A
   total of 72.1% (95%CI = 69.2-75.0) reported moderate to severe anxiety
   as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Factor influencing
   moderate to severe anxiety is a high perception of severity (OR = 2.09;
   95%CI = 1.48-2.94), high perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.71; 95%CI =
   1.17-2.50), high impact score (OR = 1.63; 95%CI = 1.17-2.26) and high
   fear score (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.01-2.14). In conclusion, the
   psychological and behavioural responses were found to increase with the
   progression of the outbreak. High anxiety levels found in this study
   warrant provision of mental health intervention during the early phase
   of COVID-19 outbreak.

AB Simple Summary Pets are an integrative part of everyday life.
   Understanding the impact that pets have on human mental health and
   wellbeing, especially during periods of prolonged social isolation, is
   vitally important to determine whether animals can be integrated in
   prevention, recovery and intervention programmes to promote mental
   health and wellbeing. Research, with Western samples, suggests a
   positive impact of pets on humans; however, there is a lack of research
   on the effects of human-animal interactions in Southeast Asia. The aim
   of this study was to address this gap and to explore whether and how
   pets impact mental health and wellbeing in Malaysia during the COVID-19
   induced movement control order (MCO). Additionally, the study explored
   if there was any interaction between other demographics, like age,
   gender, education, and pet ownership when it comes to mental health and
   wellbeing. The results show that in comparisons with people without
   animals, pet owners had significantly higher levels of mental wellbeing,
   in that they felt they could cope better with adverse situations and
   experienced significantly more positive emotions during the lockdown. On
   the other hand, there were no differences in levels of depression,
   stress, resilience, anxiety and negative emotions between the two
   participant groups. These results indicate that although the information
   about human-animal interaction is limited in Malaysia, pets can have a
   positive impact on some aspects of mental health and wellbeing and be
   actively integrated into promoting mental health and wellbeing in
   situations where people are socially isolated and experiencing
   difficulties coping with adversities or negative emotions. The adverse
   impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) on mental and physical health has been
   witnessed across the globe. Associated mental health and wellbeing
   issues include stress, social isolation, boredom, and anxiety. Research
   suggests human-animal interactions may improve the overall wellbeing of
   an individual. However, this has been less explored in Southeast Asian
   countries like Malaysia and the present study examined the effect of
   pets on the mental health and wellbeing of Malaysians during the
   lockdown, or movement control order (MCO), due to COVID-19 pandemic. A
   cross-sectional survey was carried out, with 448 Malaysian participants,
   who completed online assessments for psychological outcomes,
   psychological wellbeing, positive-negative emotions, resilience, and
   coping self-efficacy. Results indicate that pet owners reported
   significantly better coping self-efficacy, significantly more positive
   emotions, and better psychological wellbeing, but contrary to
   expectations, there was no differences on other measures. Among pet
   owners, cat owners reported more positive emotions and greater wellbeing
   than dog owners. The results show that that pets have some impact on
   improved psychological health of their owners and could be integrated
   into recovery frameworks for promoting mental health and wellbeing.

   methods can provide valuable insights to direct available resources and
   targeted interventions for transmission control. This
   ecological-correlation study evaluates the spatial dispersion of
   COVID-19 and its temporal relationships with crucial demographic and
   socioeconomic determinants in Malaysia, utilizing secondary data sources
   from public domains. By aggregating 51,476 real-time active COVID-19
   case-data between 22 January 2021 and 4 February 2021 to district-level
   administrative units, the incidence, global and local Moran indexes were
   calculated. Spatial autoregressive models (SAR) complemented with
   geographical weighted regression (GWR) analyses were executed to
   determine potential demographic and socioeconomic indicators for
   COVID-19 spread in Malaysia. Highest active case counts were based in
   the Central, Southern and parts of East Malaysia regions of Malaysia.
   Countrywide global Moran index was 0.431 (p = 0.001), indicated a
   positive spatial autocorrelation of high standards within districts. The
   local Moran index identified spatial clusters of the main high-high
   patterns in the Central and Southern regions, and the main low-low
   clusters in the East Coast and East Malaysia regions. The GWR model, the
   best fit model, affirmed that COVID-19 spread in Malaysia was likely to
   be caused by population density (beta coefficient weights = 0.269),
   followed by average household income per capita (beta coefficient
   weights = 0.254) and GINI coefficient (beta coefficient weights =
   0.207). The current study concluded that the spread of COVID-19 was
   concentrated mostly in the Central and Southern regions of Malaysia.
   Population's average household income per capita, GINI coefficient and
   population density were important indicators likely to cause the spread
   amongst communities.

   implementation of MCO has created various social crises, especially the
   issue of domestic violence (DV). Thus, this article aims to examine the
   impact of MCO on the issue of DV in terms of contributing factors and
   the role of stakeholders in addressing this issue during MCO. The study
   involved secondary data collection and content analysis. Our findings
   indicate that during the MCO period, there are six contributing factors
   to DV, namely environmental constraints, drug and alcohol influence,
   dependence on spouses, lack of strong support system, individual
   internal conflict, and lack of knowledge about DV. There are several
   government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have
   concern and carry out their responsibilities to assist in terms of
   financial, campaigns, counselling, and protection on these issues during
   the MCO. This study is referred vital in giving an overview of the DV
   issues that occurred during the MCO, especially in Malaysia and it is
   hoped that relevant stakeholders can further formulate a holistic
   strategy to address and combat the DV issue that is increasingly getting
   critical in this country.

AB Objectives: While the issue of aerosolization of virus from the blood
   occurs during usage of energy sources scare practitioners, there have
   been no reported instances of healthcare workers (HCWs) being infected.
   COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets and
   contact routes. Therefore, the ultimate decision for surgery, should be
   based on which is the safest, quickest route and concurrently ensuring
   that HCWs are protected during these surgeries. During the time of
   crisis, HCWs need to concentrate and channel resources to the care of
   those affected by the coronavirus hence judicious allocation of
   resources is mandatory. We present the guidelines and recommendations on
   gynecological laparoscopic surgery during this COVID-19 outbreak in
   Malaysia. Materials and Methods: Thorough search of articles and
   recommendations were done to look into the characteristics of the virus
   in terms of transmission and risks during surgery. Smoke plume
   characteristics, composition and risk of viral transmission were also
   studied. Search includes The WHO Library, Cochrane Library and
   electronic databases (PubMed, Google scholar and Science Direct).
   Conclusion: We concluded that there is no scientific basis of shunning
   laparoscopic approach in surgical intervention. Ultimately, the guiding
   principles would be of reducing the anesthetic and surgical duration,
   the availability of full protective gear for HCWs during the surgery and
   the status of the patient. It is mandatory for viral swab tests to be
   done within the shortest window period possible, for all cases planned
   for surgery.

AB For decades, Malaysia has been heavily dependent on unskilled and
   temporarily contracted migrant workers to fulfil labour gaps in the
   country. While Malaysia's economy continues to rely on migrant workers,
   the COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated their precarious working
   and living conditions. In-depth interviews with Nepali migrant workers
   and community leaders in Malaysia and Nepal in 2021 revealed the
   incidence of labour rights violations, compounded by the lack of access
   to justice and effective remedies. Besides, workers are allegedly no
   longer benefiting from the competitive wages, subsequently limiting the
   value of their remittance to Nepal. We argue that these incidents serve
   as the drivers of the changing views of mobility, eventually influencing
   the emigration environment in which the social construction of migration
   exists in Nepal. This study examines the migratory realities in the
   Nepal-Malaysia migration corridor during the pandemic, subsequently
   contributing to current debate on the aspiration-ability model as a

AB Background: COVID-19 emerged as a major public health outbreak in late
   2019. Malaysia reported its first imported case on 25th January 2020,
   and adopted a policy of extensive contact tracing and hospitalising of
   all cases. We describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases
   nationwide and determine the risk factors associated with disease
   severity.
   Method: Clinical records of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases aged >=
   12 years admitted to 18 designated hospitals in Malaysia between 1st
   February and 30th May 2020 with complete outcomes were retrieved.
   Epidemiological history, co-morbidities, clinical features,
   investigations, management and complications were captured using REDCap
   database. Variables were compared between mild and severe diseases.
   Univariate and multivariate regression were used to identify
   determinants for disease severity.
   Findings: The sample comprised of 5889 cases (median age 34 years, male
   71.7%). Majority were mild (92%), and 3.3% required intensive care, with
   80% admitted within the first five days. Older age (>= 51 years),
   underlying chronic kidney disease and chronic pulmonary disease, fever,
   cough, diarrhoea, breathlessness, tachypnoea, abnormal chest radiographs
   and high serum CRP (>= 5 mg/dL) on admission were significant
   determinants for severity (p<0.05). The case fatality rate was 1.2%, and
   the three commonest complications were liver injuries (6.7%), kidney
   injuries (4%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2.3%).
   Interpretations: Lower case fatality rate was possibly contributed by
   young cases with mild diseases and early hospitalisation. Abnormal chest
   radiographic findings in elderly with tachypnoea require close
   monitoring in the first five days to detect early deterioration. (C)

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene
   and xylene (BTEX) are air pollutants that harm human health. This study
   aims to identify BTEX concentrations before the lockdown known as the
   Movement Control Order was imposed (BMCO), during the imple-mentation of
   the Movement Control Order (MCO), and then during the Conditional
   Movement Control Order (CMCO). These orders were introduced during the
   COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The study utilised data measured by the
   continuous monitoring of BTEX using online gas chromatography
   instruments located at three urban area stations. The results showed
   that the BTEX concentrations reduced by between-38% and-46% during the
   MCO compared to the BMCO period. The reduction of human mobility during
   the MCO and CMCO influenced the lower BTEX concentrations recorded at a
   station within the Kuala Lumpur area. The results of the BTEX diagnostic
   ratios and principal component analysis showed that the major source of
   BTEX, especially during the BMCO and CMCO periods, was motor vehicle
   emissions. Further investi-gation, using correlation analysis and polar
   plots, showed that the BTEX concentrations were also influenced by
   meteorological variables such as wind speed, air temperature and
   relative humidity.

AB The availability of COVID-19 vaccines and mass vaccination programmes in
   adults have significantly reduced the case attack rates and disease
   burden. COVID-19 vaccination successfully decreases the population at
   risk of infection, allowing for the safer re-opening of economies and
   reducing the pandemic's crippling impact on healthcare systems. However,
   the rapidly mutating severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2
   poses challenges in diminishing vaccine-induced immunity and vaccinating
   a significant proportion of adults to achieve herd immunity. These
   challenges necessitated adolescent vaccination. With the recent
   emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant and the increasing
   COVID-19 hospitalisation rates of children below 12 years old, many
   countries opted to also vaccinate younger children. Phase II/III
   clinical trials and real-world experience demonstrate that COVID-19
   vaccinations are effective and safe for younger children and
   adolescents. Before Malaysia introduced its national COVID-19
   vaccination programme for children 5-11 years old (which ran between
   March and June 2022), an expert advisory statement was issued by the
   College of Paediatrics, Academy of Medicine of Malaysia, to highlight
   the benefits and importance of vaccinating children. The advisory
   statement included clarifications about vaccine-related side effects
   such as post-vaccination myocarditis and allergic reactions to encourage
   informed decision making by healthcare providers and parents. This
   paper, which was prepared based on the critical appraisal of the current
   evidence, evaluation of the international experiences and the positive
   impact of COVID-19 vaccination in children, collectively sums up the
   rationale to support and ensure the success of the nationwide
   vaccination programme for children. Hence, the College recommends
   COVID-19 vaccination for children in Malaysia.

AB Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2), or 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was declared as
   pandemic in early 2020. While several studies reported the short-term
   adverse events (AE) of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, medium-term AE have
   not been extensively evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the 6-month
   side effect profiles of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Methods: This was a
   descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary hospital.
   Hospital workers who received two doses of the Cominarty (BNT162b2) mRNA
   vaccine, six months post-vaccination, were invited to participate in
   this study. All participants completed a self-reported survey assessing
   AEs occurrence and severity, duration of onset and recovery and if they
   previously reported these AEs. Results: Of the 670 respondents who
   completed the survey, 229 (34.2%) experienced at least one AEs, with a
   total of 937 AEs reported during the 6-month period. After the first
   dose, the most common reported localized symptoms were pain (n = 106,
   27.2%), swelling (n = 38, 9.8%) and erythematous (n = 12, 3.1%) at
   injection site. Systemic symptoms reported include fatigue (n = 72,
   18.5%), fever (n = 55, 14.1%) and headache (n = 46, 11.8%). After the
   second dose, pain at site of injection (n = 112, 20.4%), swelling (n =
   42, 7.7%) and erythematous (n = 14, 2.6%) were among the localized AE
   reported, while fever (n = 121, 22.1%), fatigue (n = 101, 18.4%) and
   headache (n = 61, 11.1%) were the most common systemic AE. The
   proportion of respondents who experienced moderate (first dose: 156
   events; second dose: 272 events) and severe (1st dose: 21 events; 2nd
   dose: 30 events) AEs were higher after the second dose. Most AEs
   commonly resolved within 1-2 days, and none required hospitalization. No
   new onset of AE was observed 7 days post-vaccination. A total of 137
   (59.8%) participants did not proceed to formal AE reporting. Conclusion:
   Most of the AEs reported were of mild to moderate intensity and
   short-term, consistent with those reported in previous studies. No
   medium-term finding was detected in the survey. AE reporting was not
   routinely performed, necessitating the attention of health authorities
   in order to enhance pharmacovigilance.

AB Background: Several countries have implemented control measures to limit
   SARS-CoV-2 spread, including digital contact tracing, digital monitoring
   of quarantined individuals, and testing of travelers. These raise
   ethical issues around privacy, personal freedoms, and equity. However,
   little is known regarding public acceptability of these measures.
   Methods: In December 2020, we conducted a survey among 3635 respondents
   in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia to understand public perceptions
   on the acceptability of COVID-19 control measures. Findings: Hong Kong
   respondents were much less supportive of digital contact tracing and
   monitoring devices than those in Malaysia and Singapore. Around
   three-quarters of Hong Kong respondents perceived digital contact
   tracing as an unreasonable restriction of individual freedom; < 20%
   trusted that there were adequate local provisions preventing these data
   being used for other purposes. This was the opposite in Singapore, where
   nearly 3/4 of respondents agreed that there were adequate data
   protection rules locally. In contrast, only a minority of Hong Kong
   respondents viewed mandatory testing and vaccination for travelers as
   unreasonable infringements of privacy or freedom. Less than 2/3 of
   respondents in all territories were willing to be vaccinated against
   COVID-19, with a quarter of respondents undecided. However, support for
   differential travel restrictions for vaccinated and unvaccinated
   individuals was high in all settings. Interpretation: Our findings
   highlight the importance of sociopolitical context in public perception
   of public health measures and emphasize the need to continually monitor
   public attitudes toward such measures to inform implementation and
   communication strategies. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

AB The perspectives of hypertensive patients on the state of hypertension
   control during the ongoing pandemic restrictions have not been
   extensively studied in Malaysia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess
   the impact of socio-demographic factors, health literacy, and adherence
   on the overall hypertension management in a group of Malaysian
   hypertensive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous, online
   cross-sectional study was conducted over three months that involved a
   group of Malaysian adults with hypertension. A validated,
   self-administered 30-item questionnaire was prepared in Malay and
   English languages on Google Forms. The link was then distributed to
   participants on social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). Following survey
   validation, a pilot study with 30 participants who met the inclusion
   criteria was carried out. The total scores for health literacy,
   adherence, and pandemic impact on hypertension control were calculated
   and compared across all independent variables. In a total of 144 study
   participants, controlled blood pressure was reported in 77% (N = 111).
   There were good levels of adherence and health literacy scores but
   moderate levels of pandemic impact scores. The total adherence scores
   showed a statistically significant difference between age groups (chi(2)
   = 6.48, p = 0.039) and those who reported having controlled and
   uncontrolled blood pressure (U = 1116, p = 0.001). Moreover, the
   analysis revealed statistically significant differences in total
   pandemic impact scores based on the age group (chi(2) = 15.008, p =
   0.001), household income (chi(2) = 6.887, p = 0.032), employment (U =
   1712, p = 0.006), and marital status (U = 520.5, p < 0.001). The
   youngest age group (18-39) years, the lowest income group, unemployed
   and unmarried individuals, had significantly higher pandemic impact
   scores. This denotes that those individuals were more prone to be
   negatively affected by the pandemic regarding their hypertension
   management. Most participants reported relatively controlled blood
   pressure and good levels of health literacy as well as adherence amidst
   the pandemic. To a moderate extent, study participants perceived that
   the pandemic had a negative effect on hypertension management. The
   perceived negative impact of the pandemic was attributed to several
   socio-demographic factors, such as age, household income, employment,
   and marital status.

   specifically on the community's actions to protect themselves from the

   Indigenous understanding of illness and health, the Orang Asli took the
   threat of the pandemic seriously and responded with proactive steps to
   keep their community safe, which included setting up barricades and
   checkpoints to control movement into their villages, performing health
   maintenance rituals and prayers and retreating into the forest. We argue
   that the Orang Asli's response mitigated the spread of the virus into
   their villages. Their adaptation and resilience emphasize the need to
   respect their traditional knowledge and way of life, as well as the
   importance of strengthening the Orang Asli's control over their

   examine the effects of super-spreading events due to mass gatherings and
   the effectiveness of the various Movement Control Order (MCO) stringency
   levels on the outbreak progression of COVID-19 in Malaysia. The
   effective reproduction number, Rt, was estimated by adopting and
   modifying an Rt estimation algorithm using a validated distribution mean
   of 3.96 and standard deviation of 4.75 with a seven-day sliding window.
   The Rt values generated were validated using thea moving window SEIR
   model with a negative binomial likelihood fitted using methods from the
   Bayesian inferential framework. A Pearson's correlation between the Rt
   values estimated by the algorithm and the SEIR model was r = 0.70, p <
   0.001 and r = 0.81, p < 0.001 during the validation period The Rt
   increased to reach the highest values at 3.40 (95% CI 1.47, 6.14) and
   1.72 (95% CI 1.54, 1.90) due to the Sri Petaling and Sabah electoral
   process during the second and third waves of COVID-19 respectively. The
   MCOs was able to reduce the Rt values by 63.2 to 77.1% and 37.0 to 47.0%
   during the second and third waves of COVID-19, respectively. Mass
   gathering events were one of the important drivers of the COVID-19
   outbreak in Malaysia. However, COVID-19 transmission can be fuelled by
   noncompliance to Standard Operating Procedure, population mobility,
   ventilation and environmental factors.

   the responses taken by both countries with the assistance of the
   conceptual review analysis method. Despite within the same region and as
   a neighbouring state, the approaches taken by Singapore are different
   compared to Malaysia. In Singapore's approaches, they implemented more
   flexible and relaxed plans, and the government's effort in contact
   tracing is appropriate in today's world, which by introducing
   digitalisation of public health records as well as the dependence on

   of the spread of infections due to serious pandemic COVID-19.
   Design/methodology/approach For an enhanced understanding of the impact
   of spatial arrangements of public spaces plan on the effective
   implementation of social distancing this study has used the space syntax
   analysis method. The MPSP clubhouse building in Penang, Malaysia was
   selected as the case study. The level of permeability and wayfinding
   were determined in the building plan and were illustrated using
   photoshop software to depict the interrelation between the indoor spaces
   and building circulation. Graphs of the depth of space were used to
   analyze the level of permeability and wayfinding to illustrate the
   possibility of social distancing in the plan. Findings The result of the
   study shows the significant role of proper plan layout design on social
   distancing. While clear and direct wayfinding can positively be
   associated with more effective social distancing, the inefficient design
   of user access, inappropriate locations of multiple entry and exit and
   indefinite directions of users' inside buildings can impose slight
   limitations. The average level of permeability might suggest ineffective
   spatial arrangement, ignoring the needs of spatial segregation. The
   study further found that the linear plan layouts with proper zoning and
   effective management strategies can be considered a proper layout to
   facilitate social distancing and the spread of COVID-19.
   Originality/value The current study is unique in terms of examination of
   the spatial configuration of linear public spaces plan layout for
   possible temporary adaptability to curb disease spread during the
   unexpected advent of a pandemic. Based on researchers' best of knowledge
   it is the first time that the impact of recreational space design on
   social distancing has been examined. The study also originally sheds
   light on the fact that the commonly used guideline for the social
   distancing of 1-2 m between 2 persons, in reality, is practically
   inadequate given the nature of the sports activities.

AB Vaccination is the primary preventive measure against the COVID-19
   infection, and an additional vaccine dosage is crucial to increase the
   immunity level of the community. However, public bias, as reflected on
   social media, may have a significant impact on the vaccination program.
   We aim to investigate the attitudes to the COVID-19 vaccination booster
   in Malaysia by using sentiment analysis. We retrieved 788 tweets
   containing COVID-19 vaccine booster keywords and identified the common
   topics discussed in tweets that related to the booster by using latent
   Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and performed sentiment analysis to
   understand the determinants for the sentiments to receiving the
   vaccination booster in Malaysia. We identified three important LDA
   topics: (1) type of vaccination booster; (2) effects of vaccination
   booster; (3) vaccination program operation. The type of vaccination
   further transformed into attributes of "az", "pfizer", "sinovac", and
   "mix" for determinants' assessments. Effect and type of vaccine booster
   associated stronger than program operation topic for the sentiments, and
   "pfizer" and "mix" were the strongest determinants of the tweet's
   sentiments after the Boruta feature selection and validated from the
   performance of regression analysis. This study provided a comprehensive
   workflow to retrieve and identify important healthcare topic from social
   media.

AB Lockdown implementation during COVID-19 pandemic has caused many
   negative impacts in various aspect of life, including in the academic
   world. Routine disruption to teaching and learning environment has
   raised concerns to the wellbeing of university staff and students. This
   study aimed to examine the subjective wellbeing of the university
   community in Northern Malaysia during lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic
   and the factors affecting it. An online cross-sectional survey involving
   1148 university staff and students was conducted between March and April
   2020. The research tools include the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) to
   assess subjective wellbeing and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress 21
   (DASS-21) scale for psychological distress. While we found the
   subjective wellbeing score in our study population was stable at 7.67
   (1.38), there was high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress
   with 27.4%, 18.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. The students reported higher
   levels of psychological distress compared to staff. The PWI score was
   seen to be inversely affected by the depression and stress score with a
   reduction in the PWI score by 0.022 (95% CI -0.037 to -0.007) and 0.046
   (95% CI -0.062 to -0.030) with every one-unit increment for each
   subscale, respectively. Those who perceived to have more difficulty due
   to the lockdown also reported low subjective wellbeing. Thus, it is
   crucial to ensure policies and preventative measures are in place to
   provide conducive teaching and learning environment. Additionally, the
   detrimental psychological effects especially among students should be
   addressed proactively.

AB Korean Wave is a global phenomenon that has made social media a major
   platform for promoting cultural products. Having fans from all over the
   world demonstrates its suitability to be a subject of study in the
   process of how the development of media technology has transformed
   people's lives. This article aims to explore the process of
   mediatization in society. This study seeks to explore how media
   technology plays a role in changing the culture of every day. Looking at
   the Korean wave, the researcher sought to understand the relationship
   between fans among gen Z and the phenomenon. This study is a qualitative
   research, using nethnography as a data collection technique. Samples
   were selected based on predefined criteria and then used Nvivo12
   software to analyse the findings. The researcher further refined this
   study by focusing on the duration of movement control order only. This
   study seeks to understand how the entertainment industry survived and
   the relationship between the Korean wave phenomenon and fans in the face
   of a pandemic. The study found that despite the global pandemic, with a
   high level of digitalization among gen Z, the consumption of Korean
   cultural products among fans is still ongoing. Fan experience such as
   attending concerts and sharing information can still be done using the
   applications via media communication devices such as mobile phones,
   computers and tablets. The development of media communication
   technologies, change the way people communicate and the culture of every

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of all including
   university students. With the preventive measures to reduce the
   transmission of COVID-19, all face-to-face teaching and learning are
   converted to e-learning. The COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of
   e-learning may influence these students' mental conditions. This study
   aimed to determine the association of factors with mental health status
   (depression, anxiety and stress) among university students in Malaysia.
   Study participants were tertiary education students from both the
   private and public universities in Malaysia. Participants were recruited
   via university emails and social media. The survey was administered via
   the online REDCap platform, from April to June 2020, during the movement
   control order period in the country. The questionnaire captured data on
   socio-demographic characteristics, academic information, implementation
   of e-learning, perception towards e-learning and COVID-19; as well as
   DASS 21 to screen for depression, anxiety and stress. The levels of
   stress, anxiety and depression were 56.5% (95% CI: 50.7%, 62.1%), 51.3%
   (95% CI: 45.6%, 57.0%) and 29.4% (95% CI: 24.3%, 34.8%) respectively.
   Most participants had good perception towards e-learning but negative
   perception on COVID-19. From the multivariate analysis, participants
   with positive perception on COVID-19 were protective towards stress
   (aOR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99), anxiety (aOR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.98)
   and depression (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99). Older students were 14%
   (aOR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.94) and 11% (aOR: 0.89: 95% CI: 0.80, 0.99)
   less likely for anxiety and depression, respectively. Students
   originated from the Malay ethnicity had higher odds (aOR: 1.93; 95% CI:
   1.05, 3.56) for depression. These findings demonstrated that the mental
   status of university students was greatly affected during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Timely and credible information should be disseminated to
   alleviate their negative perception towards COVID-19.

AB COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide. The role of fomites in
   facilitating onward transmission is plausible. This study aimed to
   determine the presence of viable virus and its persistence on the
   surfaces of fomites in wards treating COVID-19 patients in Malaysia.
   This study was conducted in two stages. First, environmental sampling
   was performed on random days in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
   general wards. Then, in the second stage, samples were collected
   serially on alternate days for 7 days in two selected general wards. In
   Stage 1, a total of 104 samples were collected from the surfaces of
   highly touched and used areas by patients and healthcare workers. Only
   three samples were tested positive for SARS-COV-2. In Stage 2, three
   surface samples were detected positive, but no persistence of the virus
   was observed. However, none of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was viable through
   tissue culture. Overall, the environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2
   was low in this hospital setting. Hospitals' strict infection control
   and the compliance of patients with wearing masks may have played a role
   in these findings, suggesting adherence to those measures to reduce
   occupational exposure of COVID-19 in hospital settings.

AB The sudden global pandemic of COVID-19 occurred in Malaysia at the
   beginning of new 2020, which increased the uncertainty of the economy.
   As a highly demanded industry during diseases, COVID-19-related news had
   a mixed influence on investors' confidence in the healthcare industry,
   so the short-term market reaction of the Malaysian healthcare industry
   is investigated during this unfolding event. This paper examines whether
   the "lockdown" suppressed the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on stock
   performance in 12 listed healthcare companies in Malaysia. We consider
   the "lockdown" order has different impacts on samples. The hardest hit
   among the four events is the first announcement of lockdown, whose
   cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR) is negative (CAAR<0), for its
   strict movement control. However, the impacts of the following three
   lockdown events are positive and less severe as the market gradually
   digest these kinds of news and the deregulation of movement control.
   Previous studies have justified the influence of disease outbreaks on
   the stock market; however, this study compensates for other studies by
   employing the event study methodology (ESM) approach to provide the
   first empirical evidence of the unprecedented influence of "lockdown" on
   Malaysian healthcare stock market. This study has practical implications
   for Malaysian financial markets that the lockdown orders matter for the
   Malaysian healthcare industry. The empirical results show that the stock
   market has positively affected the lockdown announcement after the first
   event. In turn, the policymakers could draw on these results related to
   stock performance to modify the regulations in the healthcare industry.

   closure is likely to impact adolescents' behavioral health due to the
   extreme change in routine. The current study aimed to explore
   adolescents' behavioral health experiences during the beginning of the
   outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was done using qualitative
   methods to interview 15 adolescent participants (n =15) from low-income
   households in Malaysia. The study lasted for 2 months amidst the
   outbreak and data were collected via online based on focus group
   discussions. The results revealed that adolescents faced four main
   themes of experience during the COVID-19 pandemic: Alteration of sleep
   patterns, stress-related fatigue, dysfunctional eating patterns and lack
   of physical activity. This first-hand experience shows that knowledge
   and skills of adolescents' behavioral practices during outbreak deserves

AB COVID-19 has spread to more than a hundred countries worldwide since the
   first case reported in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. As one of the
   countries affected by the spread of COVID-19 cases, the local government
   of Malaysia has issued several policies to reduce the spread of this
   outbreak. One of the measures taken by the Malaysian government, namely
   the Movement Control Order, has been carried out since March 18, 2020.
   In order to provide precise information to the government so that it can
   take the appropriate measures, many researchers have attempted to
   predict and create the model for these cases to identify the number of
   cases each day and the peak of this pandemic. Therefore, hospitals and
   health workers can anticipate a surge in COVID-19 patients. In this
   research, confirmed, recovered, and death cases prediction was performed
   using the neural network as one of the machine learning methods with
   high accuracy. The neural network model used is the Multi-Layer
   Perceptron, Neural Network Auto-Regressive, and Extreme Learning
   Machine. The three models calculated the average percentage error (APE)
   values for 7 days and obtained APE values for most cases less than 10%;
   only 1 case in the last day of one method had an APE value of
   approximately 11%. Furthermore, based on the best model, then the
   forecast is made for the next 7 days. In conclusion, this study
   identified that the MLP model is the best model for 7-step ahead
   forecasting for confirmed, recovered, and death cases in Malaysia.
   However, according to the result of testing data, the ELM performs
   better than the MLP model. (C) 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing

AB Pharmacy practice is the discipline concerning the roles of pharmacists

   sectors, such as academics, community, enforcement, hospital,
   industrial, jurisprudence, military, regulatory and research and
   development. In addressing the crisis brought on by the coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pharmacists and technicians have been
   highly involved in the delivery of healthcare services. Malaysia has a
   distinct two-tier healthcare system and within this context, it is
   essential to integrate services during a crisis to maximise the
   available but limited medical resources. Often, the focus is on
   realistic and logical public-private partnerships. However, integrating
   different ministries offering healthcare facilities is also important
   and inter-agency pharmacy practice coordination must be optimised. The
   Malaysian Armed Forces Health Services can be primed to enhance the
   nation's healthcare capacity and capability. As the COVID-19 pandemic
   continues to grip the nation and cause an unprecedented number of
   Malaysians to become very ill, pharmacists must be resilient in leading,
   adapting and integrating well-rounded strategies in their respective
   fields to ensure good pharmacy practice.

   Under Investigation (PUI) and close contacts with positive COVID-19
   cases in Malaysia who are under home quarantine to perform daily
   self-assessment in order to monitor their own symptoms' development. To
   achieve this, three main phases of research methods have been conducted
   where interviews have been done to thirty former COVID-19 patients in
   order to investigate the symptoms and practices conducted by the
   Malaysia Ministry of Health (MOH) in assessing and monitoring COVID-19
   patients who were under home quarantine. From the interviews, an
   algorithm using user-based collaborative filtering technique with
   Pearson correlation coefficient similarity measure is designed to cater
   the self-assessment and symptoms monitoring as well as providing
   recommendations for self-care treatments as well as medical
   interventions if the symptoms worsen during the 14-days quarantine. The
   proposed framework will involve the development of the health

   parameters and the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spread in every state
   in Malaysia. This study uses the secondary data of COVID-19, meteorology
   parameters. including AQI from the Ministry of Health Malaysia, NASA
   POWER Data Access Viewer, and Air Quality Historical Data Platform
   webpage, respectively. The parameters included in this study are daily
   cases, daily deaths, total daily cases, total daily deaths, temperature
   (T) (degrees C), relative humidity (RH) (%), wind speed (WS) (m/s),
   precipitation (P) (nun), dew point (DP) (degrees C), and air quality
   index (AQI) (API) during Movement Control Order (MCO), Conditional
   Movement Control Order (CMCO), and Recovery Movement Control Order
   (RMCO) phases. Statistical analyses such as Pearson's correlation,
   factor analysis, and factor score were used for data analysis and
   interpretation. Overall, T, WS, P, and DP are significant parameters to
   the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. Every lockdown phase is influenced by
   different meteorological parameters. The correlation analysis revealed
   that meteorological parameters had a significant impact on the COVID-19
   outbreak in Johor, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Sabah. Sarawak, Selangor.
   and W.P. Kuala Lumpur. The study also reveals that the optimal ranges of
   T (26.5 degrees C - 28.5 degrees C), RH (78% - 87%), WS (1.4 m/s - 2.7
   m/s). P (6 mm - 11 mm), and DP (23.8 degrees C - 24.75 degrees C)
   influenced the COVID-19 outbreak irrespective of states and MCOs.
   However, API (<50 API) favours lesser COVID-19 outbreaks in the country.
   The HYSPLIT trajectory model was also used to study the backward air
   mass movement to identify the sources of air pollutants reaching the
   selected states (W.P. Kuala Lumpur and Sabah). The results revealed that
   the source of air pollutants was from multiple directions, with mixed
   contributions from the land and ocean. The attempt to observe the
   influence of local climatic patterns on the pandemic has revealed that
   short term climate change in the country is significant which may
   support the COVID-19 spread. The research outcome would be helpful to
   understand the role of meteorology in the long-term effect of COVID-19
   spread in Malaysia. This study also helps the health policymakers.
   Malaysian Government, and NGOs to curb the spread in the next episode of
   COVID-19 and other related pandemics.

AB In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the global public
   health system and led to many deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is highly
   contagious and can be spread by symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals.
   As such, determining the risk of infection within a community is
   difficult. To mitigate the risk of the spread of COVID-19, the
   government of Malaysia implemented seven phases of the movement control
   order (MCO) from 18 March to 31 December 2020. However, the
   socioeconomic cost was substantial despite the effectiveness of the MCO
   in bringing down cases of infection. As noted by the Prime Minister of
   Malaysia, the final criterion that should be met is community
   empowerment. In other words, community-based mitigation measures through
   which communities unite to contain the pandemic are essential before the
   completion of the vaccination program. As a measure for controlling the
   pandemic, mitigation strategies in the new normal should be feasible,
   practical, and acceptable to communities. In this paper, we present a
   deliberation of a set of community-based monitoring criteria to ensure
   health and well-being in communities, such as efficacy, technicality,
   feedback, and sustainability. The proposed criteria will be instrumental
   in developing community-based monitoring initiatives to achieve the
   desired goals in coping with the pandemic as well as in empowering
   communities to be part of the governance process.

AB Air pollution is the culprit to yearly millions of deaths worldwide,
   deteriorating human health. What is not yet clear is the impact of
   environmental factors on susceptibility to getting infected by severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The study aimed
   to determine associations between air quality, meteorological factors,
   and COVID-19 cases in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Air pollutants and
   meteorological data in 2018-2020 were obtained from the Department of
   Environment Malaysia, while daily new COVID-19 cases in 2020 were
   obtained from the Ministry of Health Malaysia. Data collected were
   statistically analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences
   (SPSS). There were significant differences between PM10, PM2.5, SO2,
   NO2, CO, O-3, and solar radiation in 2019 and 2020 since movement
   control order (MCO) was implemented on 18 March 2020. Spearman's
   correlation test showed that COVID-19 cases were positively correlated
   with PM10 (r = 0.131, p < 0.001), PM2.5 (r = 0.151, p < 0.001), SO2 (r =
   0.091, p = 0.003), NO2 (r = 0.228, p < 0.001), CO (r = 0.269, p =
   0.001), and relative humidity (RH) (r = 0.106, p = 0.001), whereas
   ambient temperature (AT) was negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases
   (r = -0.118, p < 0.001). Further, multiple linear regression suggested
   that NO2 and AT (R-2 = 0.071, p < 0.001, f(2) = 0.08) were the most
   significant air pollutant and meteorological factors with weak
   contribution that influenced the incidence of COVID-19 cases in Kuala
   Lumpur. In general, better air quality, lower RH, higher AT, along with
   the targeted approach implemented thus far, have proven to curb the
   spread of this virus infection in Malaysia. This study supports future
   research in studies documented to understand the potential of
   transmission, survival, and infection of SARS-CoV-2.

AB Background: COVID-19 was first detected in Malaysia on 25 January 2020.
   Multiple clusters were detected in Petaling District, with the first
   locally transmitted case reported on 8 February. Descriptive analyses of
   the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak in Petaling are presented,
   from the first case to the end of the first wave.
   Methods: All laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the
   Petaling District Health Office between 1 February and 26 June 2020 were
   analysed. Socio-demographic characteristics, symptoms, date of onset,
   date of exposure, travel history and history of comorbidities were
   obtained by phone interviews using one of two investigation forms. The
   descriptive analysis was conducted according to time, place and person.
   Results: There were 437 COVID-19 cases, for an incidence rate of 24/100
   000 population. Ten (2.3%) deaths and 427 recovered cases were recorded.
   Of the 437 cases, 35.5% remained asymptomatic and 64.5% were
   symptomatic. Common symptoms included fever (43.8%), cough (31.6%) and
   sore throat (16.2%); 67.3% had no comorbidities, 62.5% reported close
   contact with a confirmed case, and 76.7% were local infections.
   Transmission occurred in four main groups: religious gatherings (20.4%),
   corporations (15.1%), health facilities (10.3%) and a wholesale wet
   market (6.4%). In 31.9% of confirmed cases, an epidemiological link to
   an asymptomatic case was found.
   Conclusion: Transmission of the disease by asymptomatic cases should be
   emphasized to ensure continuous wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and
   social distancing. Further research should be conducted to better
   understand the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic cases.

   approach is used to estimate both the long-run and short-run models. The
   results of the Bounds F-test for cointegration reveal that there is a
   long-run link between job losses and the Malaysian government lockdown
   measures (both linear and non-linear). The positive association between
   job loss and lockdown measures shows that as the lockdown gets tighter,
   more people will lose their jobs. However, as time passes, especially in
   conjunction with the government stimulus package programmes, job losses
   decrease.

AB Although handwashing is an effective way to prevent infections, there is
   scarce evidence on predictors of handwashing during a pandemic. This
   paper aims to identify behavioural and demographic predictors of
   handwashing. The study surveyed 674 adults in Malaysia in May 2020
   regarding whether the time spent on social media predicted handwashing
   contingent on gender and number of children. More time spent on social
   media was positively associated with handwashing for males with three or
   more children. However, for males without children, social media use was
   negatively associated with handwashing. The association was not
   significant for males with one or two children. For females, more time
   spent on social media was significantly linked to more handwashing only
   for females with one child. Gender, a traditional predictor of
   handwashing, was a useful predictor only for those who spent more than
   three hours per day on social media and had at most one child. Number of
   children was a novel negative predictor for males who did not use social
   media and who averaged one hour per day on social media, a positive
   predictor for males who spent lots of time on social media, but not a
   predictor for females. In sum, social media use predicts handwashing,
   and is thus a helpful variable for use in targeted health communication
   during a pandemic - particularly through social media. Further, more
   conventional predictors like gender and number of children exhibit
   contingency effects with social media use.

AB There is a scarcity of population-level data of pediatric COVID-19
   infection from Southeast Asia. This study aims to describe and compare
   epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and outcome data among pediatric
   COVID-19 cases versus controls in two neighboring countries, Singapore
   and Malaysia. We used a test-negative case-control study design
   recruiting all suspected COVID-19 cases (defined by either clinical or
   epidemiological criteria) from January 2020 to March 2021 admitted to
   two main pediatric centers in Singapore and Malaysia. Data were
   collected using a standardized registry (Pediatric Acute and Critical
   Care COVID-19 Registry of Asia). The primary outcome was
   laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Univariate and multivariable logistic
   regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with
   COVID-19. This study included 923 children with median age of 4
   (interquartile range 2-9) years. Of these, 35.3% were COVID-19 cases.
   Children with COVID-19 were more likely to be asymptomatic compared with
   controls (49.4 versus 18.6%; P < 0.0001). They were also less likely to
   develop respiratory complications, such as bronchitis or pneumonia, or
   organ dysfunction. Four (1.2%) of our COVID-19 patients required
   respiratory support compared with 14.2% of controls needing respiratory
   support. COVID-19 cases tended to have lower neutrophil count but higher
   hemoglobin compared with controls. There were no reported deaths of
   COVID-19 infection; in contrast, 0.7% of the control group died. In the
   multivariable analysis, older age, travel history, and close contact
   with an infected household member were associated with COVID-19
   infection. This study shows that the majority of pediatric COVID-19
   cases were of lesser severity compared with other community acquired
   respiratory infections.

AB The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has led to abrupt changes and new
   challenges to teaching and learning (TL) practice at all levels of
   learning institutions. This includes tertiary Islamic studies courses,
   often associated with face-to-face TL. This research aims to explore the
   implementation of TL which applies Education 4.0 characteristics that
   emphasize on the use of alternative assessment. The capacity to
   incorporate Education 4.0 in TL practice of Islamic studies courses is
   considered average. Only a few courses were adapted for the Education
   4.0 characteristics as many lecturers prefer conducting summative
   assessment. This study explored alternative assessment and analyzed the
   different forms practised in Islamic studies courses at Universiti
   Kebangsaan Malaysia (UK! before the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. This
   is a qualitative study using content analysis design. Data were
   collected from course proforma of all courses offered for two academic
   sessions, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. The data were analyzed statistically
   and descriptively. The findings show that the practice of alternative
   assessment in the studies courses was initiated in the academic session
   2012-2013. Yet the number of courses involved was small and
   inconsistent. Various initiatives introduced in the Malaysian Higher
   Education Plan for 2015-2025 and UKM Education 4.0 Framework in 2017
   motivated some lecturers to apply alternative assessment in TL sessions.
   Additionally, various forms of alternative assessment used by the
   lecturers included project-based activities, fieldwork, essay writing,
   oral presentation, seminars and online assessment using digital
   technology. This study underlines the importance of alternative
   assessment in Islamic studies courses as it contributes to development
   of students' generic skills and learning experience. Besides, it reduces
   lecturers' dependence on using final examination to assess student
   performance for course learning outcomes. Further, the implementation of
   alternative assessments portrays the flexibility of Islamic studies
   courses in adapting to current changes and challenges.

AB Valued in hundreds of billions of Malaysian ringgit, the Bursa Malaysia
   Financial Services Index's constituents comprise several of the
   strongest performing financial constituents in Bursa Malaysia's Main
   Market. Although these constituents persistently reside mostly within
   the large market capitalization (cap), the existence of the individual
   constituent's causal influence or intensity relative to each other's
   performance during uncertain or even certain times is unknown. Thus, the
   key purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze the individual
   constituent's causal intensity, from early 2018 (pre-COVID-19) to the
   end of the year 2021 (post-COVID-19) using Granger causality and
   Schreiber transfer entropy. Furthermore, network science is used to
   measure and visualize the fluctuating causal degree of the source and
   the effected constituents. The results show that both the Granger
   causality and Schreiber transfer entropy networks detected patterns of
   increasing causality from pre- to post-COVID-19 but with differing
   causal intensities. Unexpectedly, both networks showed that the small-
   and mid-caps had high causal intensity during and after COVID-19. Using
   Bursa Malaysia's sub-sector for further analysis, the Insurance
   sub-sector rapidly increased in causality as the year progressed, making
   it one of the index's largest sources of causality. Even after removing
   large amounts of weak causal intensities, Schreiber transfer entropy was
   still able to detect higher amounts of causal sources from the Insurance
   sub-sector, whilst Granger causal sources declined rapidly
   post-COVID-19. The method of using directed temporal networks for the
   visualization of temporal causal sources is demonstrated to be a
   powerful approach that can aid in investment decision making.

AB Sabah in Malaysian Borneo is among the Malaysian states which reported a
   high number of detected COVID-19 cases during the current pandemic. Due
   to geographical challenges and limited resources, clinicians developed
   novel strategies for managing patients. The use of a dual oxygen
   concentrator system for mechanical ventilation is one of the innovations
   developed by retrieval team members from the Emergency Department (ED)
   of the Sabah Women and Children's Hospital. Due to conditions requiring
   isolation of patients suspected of or positive for COVID-19, high-risk
   patients were treated in an ED extension area that lacked central wall
   oxygen. Direct access to oxygen tanks became the only viable option, but
   ensuring a continuous supply was laborious. The novel setup described
   within this paper has been used on intubated patients in the ED
   extension area with moderate to high ventilator settings successfully.
   This simple setup, designed to meet the limited resources within a
   pandemic environment, needed only a turbine-driven ventilator, two
   oxygen concentrators, a 3-way connector, and three oxygen tubing. The
   application of this setup could potentially save more critically ill
   patients who are being managed in resource-limited conditions such as in
   smaller district hospitals or out in the field.

AB To curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) in Malaysia, the
   government imposed a nationwide movement control order (MCO) from 18
   March 2020 to 3 May 2020. It was enforced in four phases (i.e., MCO 1,
   MCO 2, MCO 3 and MCO 4). In this paper, we propose an initiative to
   assess the impact of MCO by using time-varying reproduction number (Rt).
   We used data from the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Systems
   Science and Engineering Coronavirus repository. Day 1 was taken from the
   first assumed local transmission of COVID-19. We estimated Rt by using
   the EpiEstim package and plotted the epidemic curve and Rt. Then, we
   extracted the mean Rt at day 1, day 5 and day 10 for all MCO phases and
   compared the differences. The Rt values peaked around day 43, which was
   shortly before the start of MCO 1. The means for Rt at day 1, day 5, and
   day 10 for all MCOs ranged between 0.665 and 1.147. The average Rt
   gradually decreased in MCO 1 and MCO 2. Although spikes in the number of
   confirmed cases were observed when restrictions were gradually relaxed
   in the later MCO phases, the situation remained under control with Rt
   values being stabilised to below unity level (Rt value less than one).

AB Urbanisation and related insufficiency of food sources is due to the
   high urban population, insufficient urban food sources, and inability of
   some urban communities to afford food due to rising costs. Food supply
   can also be jeopardised by natural and man-made disasters, such as
   warfare, pandemics, or any other calamities which result in the
   destruction of crop fields and disruption of food distribution. The
   COVID-19 pandemic exposed the impact of such calamities on the fresh
   food supply chain in Malaysia, especially when the Movement Control
   Order (MCO) policy was first implemented. The resulting panic buying
   caused some food shortage, while more importantly, the fresh food supply
   chain was severely disrupted, especially in urban areas, in the early
   stages of implementation. In this regard, urban farming, while a simple
   concept, can have a significant impact in terms of securing food sources
   for urban households. It has been used in several countries such as
   Canada, The Netherlands, and Singapore to ensure a continuous food
   supply. This paper thus attempted to review how the pandemic has
   affected Malaysian participation in urban farming and, in relation to
   that, the acceptance of urban farming in Malaysia and the initiatives
   and approaches of local governmental and non-governmental organisations
   in encouraging the urban community to participate in urban farming
   through peer-reviewed journal articles and other articles related to
   urban agriculture using the ROSES protocol. About 93 articles were
   selected after screening to ensure that the articles were related to the
   study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surge in Malaysians' awareness
   of the importance of urban farming has offered great opportunities for
   the government to encourage more Malaysian urban communities to
   participate in urban farming activities. Limitations such as relevant
   knowledge, area, and space, however, are impediments to urban
   communities' participation in these activities. Government initiatives,
   such as the Urban Community Garden Policy (Dasar Kebun Komuniti Bandar
   (DKKB)), are still inadequate as some issues are still not addressed.
   Permanent Food Production Parks (TKPM) and technology-driven practices
   are seen as possible solutions to the primary problem of land and space.
   Additionally, relevant stakeholders play a crucial role in disseminating
   relevant and appropriate knowledge and methodology applicable for urban
   farming. Partnerships between government agencies, the education sector,
   and the private sector are necessary to develop modern urban
   agricultural technologies as well as knowledge, knowhow, and supports to
   build and sustain urban community participation in urban farming
   activities.

AB Among all other industries, the spread of COVID-19 also affected the
   formal labor of different industries including domestic workers at
   employers' houses. The main purpose of this study was to analyze the
   phenomenon that how did full-time Indonesian female migrant domestic
   workers, in Malaysia and Taiwan, coped with inconvenient employment
   conditions during the pandemic. This article employed an explanatory
   qualitative approach. The data sources for this research were from
   secondary data, which mostly examined data available on online media
   related to four dimensions of decent work consisting of 1) employment
   security (losing a job), 2) protection (legally excluded/unregulated
   workers), 3) vulnerability (physical and mental abuse), and 4) income
   (low salary). The selected data from both national and international
   online media were analyzed by using NVivo 12+ software to correlate
   between the COVID-19 and working conditions of the Indonesian workers in
   Malaysia and Taiwan. This research reveals that full-time Indonesian
   female migrant domestic workers, temporarily living in employers'
   houses, have coped with inconvenient employment conditions during the
   pandemic. The findings have argued that COVID-19 caused employment
   insecurity by limiting potential foreign female domestic workers to find
   a new job; further, it also raised the insufficient protection that
   resulted into more vulnerability. In terms of income, COVID-19 also
   contributed to salary deduction for female workers in Malaysia and
   Taiwan.

AB BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
   set a huge challenge to the delivery of neurosurgical services,
   including the transfer of patients. We aimed to share our strategy in
   handling neurosurgical emergencies at a remote center in Borneo island.
   Our objectives included discussing the logistic and geographic
   challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   METHODS: Miri General Hospital is a remote center in Sarawak, Malaysia,
   serving a population with difficult access to neurosurgical services.
   Two neurosurgeons were stationed here on a rotational basis every
   fortnight during the pandemic to handle neurosurgical cases. Patients
   were triaged depending on their urgent needs for surgery or transfer to
   a neurosurgical center and managed accordingly. All patients were
   screened for potential risk of contracting COVID-19 prior to the
   surgery. Based on this, the level of personal protective equipment
   required for the health care workers involved was determined.
   RESULTS: During the initial 6 weeks of the Movement Control Order in
   Malaysia, there were 50 urgent neurosurgical consultations. Twenty
   patients (40%) required emergency surgery or intervention. There were 9
   vascular (45%), 5 trauma (25%), 4 tumor (20%), and 2 hydrocephalus cases
   (10%). Eighteen patients were operated at Miri General Hospital, among
   whom 17 (94.4%) survived. Ninety percent of anticipated transfers were
   avoided. None of the medical staff acquired COVID-19.
   CONCLUSIONS: This framework allowed timely intervention for
   neurosurgical emergencies (within a safe limit), minimized transfer, and
   enabled uninterrupted neurosurgical services at a remote center with
   difficult access to neurosurgical care during a pandemic.

   Levels [HEACL] across Malaysia before, during and after the MCO, and the
   likelihood of the pandemic quickening household conduct towards use of
   energy saving appliances based on a self-reported household survey. The
   consumption patterns were evaluated based on hours and frequency of use
   of 29 household electrical appliances. Energy consumption behaviour and
   energy efficient star label [EESL] appliances questions were also
   included in the survey to provide insights into energy-efficient
   behaviour. The survey attracted 1482 responses from 1500 households
   approached across geographic regions in Malaysia. The findings show
   significant changes in HEACL across the three periods, viz., (i) before
   MCO, (ii) during MCO, and (iii) after MCO. There was a significant
   increase in HEACL during and after the MCO. Also, the low-income group
   showed the highest shift in appreciating EESL devices over the MCO,
   while changes in their appreciation was not significant among the
   medium- and high-income groups. The results imply that energy-wasting
   habits proved hard to shift across middle- and high-income households.
   The findings presented herein are unique, which focused on Malaysia
   during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide insights for Malaysian
   policymakers when developing future action plans to stimulate a fall in
   energy consumption and a shift from conventional to EESL devices over
   the long-term.

AB Background: Age and multiple comorbidities have been reported to
   influence the case fatality rate of COVID-19 worldwide, so also in
   Malaysia; however, to date, no scientific study among the local
   population has been published to confirm this. This study aimed to
   determine the overall demographics and clinical characteristics of
   COVID-19 non-survivors in Malaysia, stratified by age (< 65 vs. >= 65
   years old). The mortality was also compared between two half-year
   periods: March-August 2020 and September 2020-March 2021.
   Method: Daily reports containing demographics and medical history of
   COVID-19 non-survivors from March 2020 to March 2021 were obtained from
   the Malaysian Ministry of Health website. All information was extracted
   retrospectively and analysed using descriptive and inferential
   statistics with SPSS.
   Results: Of 1192 COVID-19 non-survivors, the overall mean (SD) age was
   64.8 (15.7) years, with 64.7% male. Death was seen mostly among 50- to
   64-year-olds (33.1%) and 65- to 74-year-olds (24.8%). The presence of
   underlying hypertension (61.8%) and diabetes mellitus (48.2%) were the
   most common comorbid diseases encountered in the COVID-19 non-survivors.
   Underlying hypertension, stroke, heart disease and dyslipidaemia were
   significantly higher among COVID-19 non-survivors who were >= 65 years
   old compared to those < 65 (p < 0.05). Mortality was a lot higher in
   September 2020-March 2021 compared to March 2020-August 2020 (91.3% vs.
   8.3%).
   Conclusion: Older age, male gender and the presence of multimorbidity
   (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke and heart disease) are risk
   factors that contribute to mortality due to COVID-19 in Malaysia,
   especially among those 65 years old.

AB Although the negative economic impacts of COVID-19 are undiscovered, the

   Considering tourism's contribution to Malaysia's GDP, this study aims to
   examine vendors' attitudes and perceptions towards international
   tourists in night markets after the emergence of COVID-19 and the
   impacts of propagation power of COVID-19 on vendors' perceptions in
   Malaysia. As large numbers of informal workers lost 60% of their income
   worldwide due to the pandemic, a lack of research is observed on
   vendors' attitudes after the pandemic, especially in Southeast Asia. The
   study model was derived on the basis of the revised social exchange
   theory (SET). A questionnaire survey was conducted among local vendors
   in Malaysia using a multistage probability sampling method. Findings
   revealed that place attachment has a significant effect on positive
   perception but not negative perception towards international tourists'
   receptiveness. Results indicate that positive perceptions towards
   international tourists significantly and positively mediate the
   relationship among place attachment, economic gain, and involvement with
   tourist receptiveness. Moreover, the research concluded that vendors
   still have positive attitudes towards international tourists'
   receptiveness due to economic gain and their place attachment and
   involvement levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Background Primary healthcare workers (PHCWs) are at the frontline of
   dealing with viral pandemics. They may experience significant
   psychological stresses, which have hitherto not been examined in depth.
   We aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
   psychological health and wellbeing of frontline PHCWs in Malaysia.
   Method We purposively recruited PHCWs with diverse backgrounds in Klang
   Valley, Malaysia. Using longitudinal qualitative methods, we conducted
   two sequential semi-structured telephone interviews, 3 to 4 weeks apart,
   to capture different stages of the pandemic. Interviews were
   audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically. Result
   Twenty-one PHCWs participated yielding a total of forty-two interviews.
   Themes clustered around stressors associated with work, home, and
   leisure activities, emotional changes, and modifying factors. In the
   first interviews, COVID-19 had just started in Malaysia. Participants
   expressed fear about the actual and perceived personal risk of COVID-19
   infection. Most were worried about transmitting COVID-19 to their family
   members. Some felt stigmatized because of this perceived risk of
   infection. By the second interviews, participants felt safer, but
   instead focused on the need to keep other people safe. Participants'
   emotions were influenced by their perceived risk of contracting COVID-19
   infection. Internal factors such as religion enabled them to manage
   their concerns and develop personal coping strategies. Support from
   family members, colleagues, and employers promoted wellbeing during the
   pandemic. Training sessions, daily roll calls, and psychological support
   services were important in maintaining their psychological health and
   wellbeing. Many participants were hopeful and believed normalcy would
   return by the end of 2020. Conclusion PHCW's psychological health and
   wellbeing evolved throughout the early stages of the pandemic and were
   influenced by their perceived risk of contracting the disease and
   personal belief structures. Clear updates on the disease and strategies
   for keeping safe at work and socially are essential to maintaining
   PHCWs' psychological health and wellbeing.

AB The spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 resulted in unprecedented
   worldwide countermeasures such as lockdowns and suspensions of all
   retail, recreational, and religious activities for the majority of 2020.
   Nonetheless, no adequate scientific data have been provided thus far
   about the impact of COVID-19 on driving behavior and road safety,
   especially in Malaysia. This study examined the effect of COVID-19 on
   driving behavior using naturalistic driving data. This was accomplished
   by comparing the driving behaviors of the same drivers in three periods:
   before COVID-19 lockdown, during COVID-19 lockdown, and after COVID-19
   lockdown. Thirty people were previously recruited in 2019 to drive an
   instrumental vehicle on a 25 km route while recording their driving data
   such as speed, acceleration, deceleration, distance to vehicle ahead,
   and steering. The data acquisition system incorporated various sensors
   such as an OBDII reader, a lidar, two ultrasonic sensors, an IMU, and a
   GPS. The same individuals were contacted again in 2020 to drive the same
   vehicle on the same route in order to capture their driving behavior
   during the COVID-19 lockdown. Participants were approached once again in
   2022 to repeat the procedure in order to capture their driving behavior
   after the COVID-19 lockdown. Such valuable and trustworthy data enable
   the assessment of changes in driving behavior throughout the three time
   periods. Results showed that drivers committed more violations during
   the COVID-19 lockdown, with young drivers in particular being most
   affected by the traffic restrictions, driving significantly faster and
   performing more aggressive steering behaviors during the COVID-19
   lockdown than any other time. Furthermore, the locations where the most
   speeding offenses were committed are highlighted in order to provide
   lawmakers with guidance on how to improve traffic safety in those areas,
   in addition to various recommendations on how to manage traffic during
   future lockdowns.

   participants in the National Vaccination Program. A cross-sectional
   survey was conducted among a sample of vaccine-eligible and vaccinated
   individuals in Malaysia between May and July 2021. A total of 428
   respondents completed the survey. A vast majority (98.6%) of the
   respondents had registered to be vaccinated. Twenty participants (4.7%)
   expressed concerns about either registering or receiving the COVID-19
   vaccination, mainly due to their uncertainty of vaccine safety.
   Approximately 77.5% received their vaccinations. Of them, 76.8% had
   experienced vaccine-related side effects. About 40% of the side effects
   occurred more with the second dose, particularly those who received the
   Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (p < 0.001). Pain at the injection site (61.1%)
   and tiredness (48.8%) were the most reported side effects. Compared to
   those aged & GE;60 years, all age groups were more likely to exhibit
   vaccine-related side effects; meanwhile, males (OR: 0.51, 95% CI:
   0.27-0.93) were less likely to experience side effects than females.
   Those who received the Sinovac vaccine were at lower risk of
   experiencing side effects (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.03-0.22) and were more
   likely to report fewer side effects than Pfizer-BioNTech (p = 0.012) and
   Oxford-AstraZeneca groups (p= 0.001). The overall attitudes toward the
   COVID-19 vaccination program were positive. Several differences in the
   experiences of vaccine-related side effects, in terms of prevalence and
   numbers, were attributed to age, gender, and received vaccine type.</p>

AB Introduction:
   Burnout is a syndrome occurring from an overwhelming workplace stress.
   The study was done at a large teaching hospital identified as a COVID-19
   treating hospital. During COVID-19 pandemic, the country was in Movement
   Control Order since 18 March 2020 to contain the spread of the virus,
   and thus, it has increased the job workload and responsibility. The
   purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of burnout among
   emergency healthcare worker in this hospital and to identify the factors
   contributed to the burnout.
   Methods:
   A cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire among
   emergency healthcare worker from 8 May 2020 to 15 May 2020 during the
   Conditional Movement Control Order. The questionnaire was adapted from
   Michelle Post, Public Welfare, Vol. 39, No. 1, 1981, American Public
   Welfare Association and distributed via Google Forms. It consisted of 28
   questions and was rated based on a five-point Likert-type scale. The
   questions were then summed up to determine the burnout levels.
   Results:
   There were 216 respondents with 65.7% were nurses, 17.1% were doctors,
   and the rest were assistant medical officer. 51.3% of the respondents
   had burnout with 61.2% of nurses, 35.1% of doctors, and 29.6% of
   assistant medical officer. There was weak correlation (r = 0.148) with
   the years of experience working in emergency department and the level of
   burnout (p = 0.03). Among the burnout features were fatigue with 52.2%
   and frequent physical illness and feel unappreciated with 48.6% and
   45.9%, respectively. The job-related issues which predisposed to burnout
   were demand coping with an angry public with 70.2%, job overload 63.9%,
   lack clear guideline or rapid program changes 54%, and pay too little
   53.1%.
   Conclusion:
   Emergency healthcare worker has a high rate of burnout especially among
   the nurses. The factors leading to burnout were frequent exposure to
   angry public, job overload, lack of clear guidelines, and perception of
   underpaid.

AB Contemporary furniture marketing platforms that are based on furniture
   exhibitions, retail malls, and galleries were severely disrupted by the
   global COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study was conducted to
   evaluate the extent to which digital marketing tools were adopted by
   furniture manufacturers in Malaysia. The effectiveness of digital
   marketing tools was assessed as an alternative furniture marketing
   medium by means of a questionnaire distributed to various fumiture
   suppliers. The results of the questionnaire indicated that the onset on
   the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital marketing
   among furniture manufacturers of all sizes. Larger manufacturers had the
   financial means to make greater investments into digital marketing to
   utilize it compared to the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
   Digital marketing by website, email, and social media were the most
   common mediums used by furniture manufacturers. As for social media
   applications, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were the common platforms
   used by furniture manufacturers. Although some furniture manufacturers
   were familiar with digital marketing, many were not using it effectively
   due to a lack of skilled workers with the ability to manage such digital
   marketing tools. Limited financial capital, especially among the SMEs,
   also made it difficult to enable the adoption of digital marketing.

AB Background The initiation of a new drug, for instance, the coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in children could be a source of major
   concern for parents. This study aims to determine the willingness of
   parents in Malaysia to vaccinate their children younger than 12 years
   against COVID-19. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted
   nationwide in Malaysia from August 29, 2021, to October 17, 2021.
   Parents with children younger than 12 years were enrolled via the
   snowball sampling method. Results The analysis included data from 3,528
   parents (79.5%) of the 4,438 survey responses received. Of these
   parents, 2,598 (73.6%) were willing, 486 (13.8%) were not willing, and
   444 (12.6%) were still hesitant to vaccinate their children against
   COVID-19. Single parents (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval
   [CI], 1.32-3.04; P = 0.001), parents with secondary or lower education
   (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.21-1.96; P < 0.001), healthcare workers (OR, 1.7;
   95% CI, 1.34-2.26; P < 0.001), parents who had significant contact with
   COVID-19 (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.09-1.63; P = 0.006), and parents who had
   been vaccinated against COVID-19 (OR, 15.4; 95% CI, 9.76-24.33; P <
   0.001) were found more willing to immunize their children. The common
   reasons for vaccination given by parents who were willing to immunize
   their children include protection of children (99.4%), protection of
   other family members (99.3%), and effectiveness (98.2%). The common
   reasons against vaccination given by parents who were not willing to
   immunize their children were uncertainty about the new vaccine (96.1%),
   concerns about vaccine contents (93.2%), limited vaccine information
   from physicians (82.3%), and the belief of vaccine was unsafe (79.8%).
   Conclusions In this study, nearly three-quarters of parents were willing
   to vaccinate their children younger than 12 years against COVID-19. The
   parents' history of COVID-19 vaccination was the strongest independent
   predictor of their willingness to vaccinate their children. Therefore,
   future health education for the COVID-19 vaccine should focus on parents
   who are prone to vaccine refusal or hesitation, address the common
   reasons for vaccine refusal, and highlight the vaccine's benefits.

AB The rapid spread of the global pandemic COVID-19 had challenged the
   Malaysian Healthcare and Education Systems. Teaching and learning at
   dental schools across the country were drastically changed to online
   approach as the nation enforced Movement Control Order (MCO). However,
   translation of psychomotor skills still require hands-on approach to
   produce competent dentists upon graduation, but most dental schools were
   not prepared for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission that require
   more strict cross infection protocol. The aim of this paper was to
   describe the response by a dental school in Malaysia to COVID-19 in
   modifying the clinical teaching and learning, infrastructure,
   facilities, and clinical services, and enhancing the infection control
   protocol through risk assessment of COVID-19 transmission and prevention
   strategies. The paper also discusses the limitations of our approach,
   challenges in providing clinical services and supervision as well as
   implications of changes to our practice. In conclusion, COVID-19 has
   modified the delivery and implementation of clinical teaching and
   learning in Malaysia. However, within the limited fund and resources,
   dental teaching institutions need to adapt to the new normal clinical
   environment in order to ensure that dentals students graduate on time
   with sufficient clinical training.

   research. A survey taken by 408 diploma students with 377 valid answers
   for the quantitative study showed that the most common difficulties they
   encountered were in terms of interaction, concentration and motivation.
   The mean of the perceived challenges was found to be significantly
   different depending on the respondents' prior e-learning experience and
   area of residence. With regard to the relevant activities to be
   conducted virtually, most participants approved of assessments such as
   quiz, assignments and tests. Animation and gamification received the

   affected the solar photovoltaic industry in Malaysia. However, new
   policies and frameworks towards self-consumption and large-scale solar
   with net energy metering and financing options have changed the business
   models. To better understand Malaysia's present solar PV business models
   and financing options, interviews and surveys were conducted with

   Malaysian solar energy business was immune to the Covid-19 pandemic, and
   an overwhelming increase in the installation capacity took place owing
   to existing attractive policies. The study provides valuable insights on

   of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian
   government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also
   taking precautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper
   hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order
   started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%).
   This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and
   practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The results
   highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities
   and the government as well as the need for tailored health education
   programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices.

AB COVID-19 is a major health threat across the globe, which causes severe
   acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and it is highly contagious with
   significant mortality. In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for
   COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system
   and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity
   through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios
   leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to
   provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID19 pandemic.
   As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated
   using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the
   epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the
   fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of
   Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the
   trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it
   is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the
   reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound
   effect in transmission could occur after several years and this
   situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis
   also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold
   beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks
   are rather hard to eradicate. Therefore, understanding the interplay
   between distinct epidemiological factors using mathematical modelling
   approaches could help to support authorities in making informed
   decisions so as to control the spread of this pandemic effectively.

AB COVID-19 infection resulted in significant economic implications to
   patients as well as a considerable financial burden to the general
   population for preventive measures. A descriptive study was conducted
   among staff at one of the public universities in Malaysia to estimate
   the monthly out-of-pocket expenditures for preventive measures used for
   COVID-19 infection. The study tool includes questions on household
   out-of-pocket expenditure and the measurements of the impact of the
   expenditure on household income. It was found that the average
   cumulative monthly expenditures related to the preventive measures were
   US$ 45.90 (Ringgit Malaysia 187.77), which was 4.3% of the household
   income. The highest expenditures were for traditional and complementary
   medicine followed by nutraceutical/supplements and disposable facemask.
   8% of the households in this study incurred more than ten per cents of
   their monthly household income for expenditures related to COVID-19
   preventive measures. Several households are experiencing substantial
   financial implications for preventive measures related to COVID-19
   infection. This study highlights the out-of-pocket expenditures incurred
   for preventive measures were substantial for certain households.
   Effective initiatives from the government on providing subsidized
   protective personal equipment and a cost-sharing approach could help to
   alleviate the household financial burden.

AB Purpose The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has almost affected more than
   two million people and has taken more than one hundred thousand lives
   around the globe. At this current state, researchers are trying their
   best level to drive the permanent solution for this menace; hence, till
   now social distancing and hygienic lifestyle are the only solutions.
   This paper proposes a smart entrance disinfectant gate based on the
   sanitizer spray station and ultraviolet irradiation mechanisms. This
   innovative and embedded system design-oriented gate will first capture
   the image of the entrant, second, measure the temperature, third, spray
   the sanitizers and, last, provide the ultraviolet irradiation to make
   sure that the person entering any space may have fewer chances to carry
   coronavirus. The purpose of this study is to enable the IoT feature that
   helps the government officials to keep the data record of suspectable,
   exposed, infected and recovered people which will later help to reduce
   the reproductive co-efficient Ro of COVID-19 within any state of
   Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach In the current manuscript, design
   proposes a smart entrance disinfectant gate based on the sanitizer spray
   station and ultraviolet irradiation mechanisms. This design of the gate
   is enabled with the feature of the internet of things (IoT) and some
   efficient sensors along with computer vision facilities. Findings This
   paper bridges an academic research on COVID-19 and addresses IoT and
   data prediction-based solution to compute the reproductive number for
   this novel coronavirus. Originality/value This paper with the features
   such as hardware design, IoT and, last but not the least, data
   prediction and visualization makes this prototype one of its kind and
   provides approximate results for reproductive number (Ro)

AB Global concerns have been observed due to the outbreak and lockdown
   causal-based COVID-19, and hence, a global pandemic was announced by the
   World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. The Movement Control
   Order (MCO) in Malaysia acts to moderate the spread of COVID-19 through
   the enacted measures. Furthermore, massive industrial, agricultural
   activities and human encroachment were significantly reduced following
   the MCO guidelines. In this study, first, a reconnaissance survey was
   carried out on the effects of MCO on the health conditions of two urban
   rivers (i.e., Rivers of Klang and Penang) in Malaysia. Secondly, the
   effect of MCO lockdown on the water quality index (WQI) of a lake
   (Putrajaya Lake) in Malaysia is considered in this study. Finally, four
   machine learning algorithms have been investigated to predict WQI and
   the class in Putrajaya Lake. The main observations based on the analysis
   showed that noticeable enhancements of varying degrees in the WQI had
   occurred in the two investigated rivers. With regard to Putrajaya Lake,
   there is a significant increase in the WQI Class I, from 24% in February
   2020 to 94% during the MCO month of March 2020. For WQI prediction,
   Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) outperformed other models in predicting the
   changes in the index with a high level of accuracy. For sensitivity
   analysis results, it is shown that NH3-N and COD play vital rule and
   contributing significantly to predicting the class of WQI, followed by
   BOD, while the remaining three parameters (i.e. pH, DO, and TSS) exhibit
   a low level of importance.

AB Background: As preventive measures to curb coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) transmission, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore had imposed
   web-accessible regulations where the popularity of relative internet
   search volume can be obtained from Google Trends (GT). This research
   aimed to seek the relationship between public search interest and
   countries' policies, furthermore to observe whether the GT data could be
   utilized as a tool to make a risk communication during this pandemic.
   Methods: This retrospective study used GT to analyze the relative search
   volume (RSV) of keywords large-scale social restrictions (Pembatasan
   Sosial Berskala Besar - PSBB), Movement Control Order (MCO) or Perintah
   Kawalan Pergerakan (PKP) and Circuit Breaker (CB) for Indonesia,
   Malaysia and Singapore respectively. Daily number of COVID-19 confirmed
   cases were collected and analyzed using Pearson correlation and time-lag
   with P < 0.05. Every search interest peak and mobility trends changes
   were qualitatively analyzed.
   Results: The results exhibited the relationship between the government
   containment policy, the peaks of analyzed RSV keywords and the mobility
   trends. The containment policy has significant relationships with
   COVID-19 daily cases (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: These results indicated that the government could use GT RSV
   as a strategy of crisis and risk communication to intervene public
   behavior towards the pandemic.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered the education sector.
   Rather than the impact of COVID-19, many higher education institutions
   (HEIs) are on the verge of insolvency due to a lack of digital
   transformation readiness and poor business models. The bleak financial
   future many HEIs will face while others may be forced to close their
   doors completely will erode HEIs' ability to fulfil their societal
   responsibilities. However, HEIs that have survived and maintained their
   operations anticipate the transition to online learning or the effects
   of any economic crisis, including university closures in the short,
   medium, or long term. The entire educational ecosystem was forced to
   transform its operations quickly and entirely to an online
   teaching-learning scenario in just a few weeks. Notably, HEIs that have
   long offered online courses worldwide can easily transition to digital
   teaching and learning when necessary. The second roundtable session's
   result of the International Higher Education Conference, organized by
   INTI International University on March 31 2022, was used to organize a
   Delphi method to identify further factors that positively impact HEIs by
   COVID-19. The importance of these factors was then determined using
   Kendall's coefficient of concordance. Recommendations on how HEIs should
   move towards institutional sustainability during the endemic phase are
   presented accordingly.

   advantage of by the newly formed coalition government, the Perikatan

   to authoritarianism, blanketed by its policies to tackle the Covid-19
   pandemic. However, it is argued that the pandemic brought an adverse
   effect to PN's regime integrity in a way that it had both became the
   source of regime sustainability and regime subversion. While the
   democratic reversal is clearly apparent, the failure of Muhyiddin's
   administration to effectively deal with the challenges of good
   governance during the pandemic had eventually led to its own demise.

AB The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic had prompted many governments to
   enforce lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading. In Malaysia, a
   series of Movement Control Orders (MCO) were introduced starting March
   18, 2020. As a result, many people's lives were affected, including
   university students. These affected students had to stay in their campus
   residential facilities, isolated from family, relatives and friends,
   which could lead to the feeling of loneliness. This study aims to
   explore the phenomenon among students stranded on campus during MCO
   periods. Approximately 243 students from several public universities
   were surveyed using Google form. Results from the 210 usable responses
   showed that most of these students experienced moderate loneliness and
   often used coping approaches like acceptance, positive interpretation,
   active coping, and active solitude. Friends seemed to be a more
   immediate source to seek for support in times of isolation. Correlation
   results suggested that social support availability is negatively
   associated with student loneliness experience, and positively related
   with student coping strategies. Specifically, the availability of
   support from friends and significant others may minimize loneliness
   experience.

AB The outbreak of the pandemic Covid-19 has transformed the education
   system in most countries worldwide. Following the lockdown measures in
   Malaysia, the Malaysian education system has fully transformed from
   conventional learning to online learning or known as e-learning as an
   alternative to minimize social contacts and physical communication to
   curb the transmission of Covid-19. In this regard, this study aims to
   identify the challenges faced by students in higher learning
   institutions throughout Malaysia during the implementation of the
   e-learning program. This study is based on a large sampling consisting
   of 2394 students from both public and private universities. The result
   from this study is analyzed through inferential methods such as the
   Spatial Analysis, the Principal Component Analysis, and the Mann-Whitney
   U test and through descriptive methods using the frequency analysis and
   the percentage analysis. Findings from this study suggest that location
   significantly influenced the challenges faced by students throughout the
   implementation of e-learning in higher learning institutions. For
   example, students in rural areas which can be identified as "vulnerable
   groups" are more likely to face both technical and connection with the
   internet access, tend to have a declining focus on learning and are
   prone to physical health problems, facing social isolation and low
   digital literacy compared to students in urban areas. Based on
   geographical analysis, students in Sabah, Perlis, and Melaka are most at
   risk of facing e-learning challenges. An anomaly case of students in
   Kuala Lumpur, however, posed another different result compared to other
   cities as they confront similar challenges with students in rural areas.
   This study provides the nuances of location and its implications for
   vulnerable groups that may put them at disadvantage in the e-learning
   program. Findings from this study will help to inform the relevant
   authorities and policymakers in improving the implementation of
   e-learning in Malaysia, especially towards the vulnerable groups so that
   it can be delivered more systematically and efficiently.

   increasingly recognised in this COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to
   explore the emergency preparedness of community pharmacists (CPs) for
   COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among community
   pharmacists using cluster sampling followed by convenient sampling. A
   self-administered questionnaire was formulated using references from the
   previous literature and the WHO preparedness checklist. Descriptive
   analysis was undertaken for the participants' socio-demographic
   characteristics. All the data collected were entered into the
   Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 24 (SPSS V.24), (IBM
   SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) for
   analysis. Results: Most of the CPs had five or fewer years of practice
   experience, and they had all the mandatory information relating to the
   needs of their communities regarding the disease. The participants knew
   where to acquire these resources whenever needed. They were able to
   recognise the signs and symptoms of the disease. Most participants felt
   that they were confident to provide patient education and carry out
   their duties during these challenging times. There was a strong position
   correlation between preparedness and the perceived response of the
   participants. Conclusion: The community pharmacists in Malaysia are
   prepared enough for COVID-19 pandemic management and perceive that they
   can respond during any unprecedented situations, such as COVID-19.
   Community pharmacists were aware of the challenges that they need to
   face in their community regarding COVID-19.

AB In this study, we describe the incidence and distribution of COVID-19
   cases in Malaysia at district level and determine their correlation with
   absolute population and population density, before and during the period
   that the Delta variant was dominant in Malaysia. Methods: Data on the
   number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in each of the 145
   districts in Malaysia, between 20 September 2020 and 19 September 2021,
   were manually extracted from official reports. The cumulative number of
   COVID-19 cases, population and population density of each district were
   described using choropleth maps. The correlation between population and
   population density with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in each
   district in the pre-Delta dominant period (20 September 2020-29 June
   2021) and during the Delta dominant period (30 June 2021-19 September
   2021) were determined using Pearson's correlation. Results: COVID-19
   cases were strongly correlated with both absolute population and
   population density (Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) = 0.87 and r =
   0.78, respectively). A majority of the districts had higher numbers of
   COVID-19 cases during the Delta dominant period compared to the
   pre-Delta period. The correlation coefficient in the pre-Delta dominant
   period was r = 0.79 vs. r = 0.86 during the Delta dominant period,
   whereas the pre-Delta dominant population density was r = 0.72, and in
   the Delta dominant period, r = 0.76. Conclusion: More populous and
   densely populated districts have a higher risk of transmission of
   COVID-19, especially with the Delta variant as the dominant circulating
   strain. Therefore, extra and more stringent control measures should be
   instituted in highly populated areas to control the spread of COVID-19.

AB COVID-19 is a major health threat across the globe, which causes severe
   acute respiratory syndrome, and it is highly contagious with significant
   morbidity and mortality. In this paper, we examine the feasibility and
   implications of several phases of Movement Control Order (MCO) and some
   non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies implemented by
   Malaysian government in the year 2020 using a mathematical model with
   SIR-neural network approaches. It is observed that this model is able to
   mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic and,
   Malaysia had succeeded to flatten the infection curve at the end of the
   Conditional MCO (CMCO) period. However, the signs of 'flattening' with
   R-0 of less than one had been taken as a signal to ease up on some
   restrictions enforced before. Though the government has made compulsory
   the use of face masks in public places to control the spread of
   COVID-19, we observe a contrasting finding from our model with regards
   to the impacts of wearing mask policies in Malaysia on R0 and the
   infection curve. Additionally, other events such as the Sabah State
   Election at the end of third quarter of 2020 has also imposed a dramatic
   COVID-19 burden on the society and the healthcare systems.

AB Since the 1960s, many electronic travel aids have been developed for
   people with low vision or blindness to improve their independent travel
   skills, but uptake of these specialist devices has been limited. This
   study investigated what technologies orientation and mobility (O&M)
   clients in Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support
   their travel, to inform technology research and development. This
   two-phase mixed-methods study surveyed O&M clients face-to-face in
   Malaysia (n = 9), and online in Australia (n = 50). Participants managed
   safe walking using a human guide, long cane, or guide dog when their
   vision was insufficient to see hazards, but a smartphone is now a
   standard travel aid in both Australia and Malaysia. Participants relied
   on smartphone accessibility features and identified 108 apps they used
   for travel: for planning (e.g., public transport timetables), sourcing
   information in transit (e.g., GPS location and directions, finding a
   taxi), sensory conversion (e.g., camera-to-voice, voice-to-text,
   video-to-live description), social connections (e.g., phone, email,
   Facebook), food (e.g., finding eateries, ordering online), and
   entertainment (e.g., music, games). They wanted to 'carry less junk',
   and sought better accessibility features, consistency across platforms,
   and fast, reliable, real-time information that supports confident,
   non-visual travel, especially into unfamiliar places.

AB The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still evolving and
   affecting millions of lives. E-government and social media have been
   used widely during this unprecedented time to spread awareness and
   educate the public on preventive measures. However, the extent to which
   the 2 digital platforms bring to improve public health awareness and
   prevention during a health crisis is unknown. In this study, we examined
   the influence of e-government and social media on the public's attitude
   to adopt protective behavior. For this purpose, a Web survey was
   conducted among 404 Malaysian residents during the Recovery Movement
   Control Order (RMCO) period in the country. Descriptive and multiple
   regression analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS software. Social media
   was chosen by most of the respondents (n = 331 or 81.9%) as the source
   to get information related to COVID-19. Multiple regression analysis
   suggests the roles of e-government and social media to be significantly
   related to people's attitudes to engage in protective behavior. In
   conclusion, during the COVID-19 outbreak, public health decision makers
   may use e-government and social media platforms as effective tools to
   improve public engagement on protective behavior. This, in turn, will
   help the country to contain the transmission of the virus.

AB Background: Medical students are not spared from the challenges related
   to the Covid-19 lockdown. The fear and uncertainties may lead to
   traumatic symptoms and test their resilience and sense of coping. Thus,
   this study aims to determine the prevalence of peri-traumatic distress
   symptoms and its association with the level of resilience and the coping
   strategies used during the lockdown among medical students.Materials and
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey
   involving medical students from a public university in Malaysia. It was
   conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown or Movement Control Order (MCO)
   where the students were asked to fill in the COVID-19 Peri-traumatic
   Distress Index (CPDI), Brief COPE Inventory, and Connor Davidson
   Resilience Scale (CDRS-25).Results: A total of 282 clinical and 172
   pre-clinical medical students were involved. Peri-traumatic distress
   symptoms were reported by 27% out of the total students. This study
   found that those who were having peritraumatic distress symptoms were
   from the pre-clinical years, had poor internet access, as well as lower
   resilience levels, and used more dysfunctional coping strategies.
   Pre-clinical medical students with difficult internet access were eight
   times more likely to have peritraumatic distress symptoms.Conclusions:
   Given the high level of peri-traumatic distress symptoms reported by
   medical students during the lockdown, it is vital to identify the
   vulnerable students, assess their needs and risks to mental health
   problems during this challenging time as the pandemic is still ongoing
   with countries going in and out of lockdown depending on the cases at
   the time. The university administration for each University in Malaysia
   will need to have a clear academic guideline and policy as well as
   providing improved infrastructure to minimize the distress faced by
   medical students.

AB Aim The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the delivery of healthcare to
   vulnerable older adults, prompting the expansion of telemedicine usage.
   This study surveyed the acceptance of virtual medical consultations
   among older adults and caregivers within geriatric outpatient services
   in a tertiary hospital during the pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional
   survey was conducted among caregivers and patients attending geriatric
   outpatient services in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The survey measured the
   availability of equipment for virtual consultations, prior knowledge and
   experience of telemedicine, and willingness to consult geriatricians
   through virtual technology, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and
   Use of Technology (UTAUT) scale. Results A total of 197 caregivers and
   42 older patients with a mean age of 54.28 (+/- 13.22) and 75.62 (+/-
   7.32) years, respectively, completed the survey. One hundred and
   fifty-six (79.2%) of the caregivers were adult children accompanying
   patients. The mean UTAUT score was 65.97 (+/- 13.71) out of 90, with
   66.64 (+/- 13.25) for caregivers and 62.79 (+/- 15.44) for older adults,
   suggesting a high acceptance of adopting virtual consultations in lieu
   of face-to-face care. The independent predictors of acceptance of
   virtual consultation were : possession of an electronic device capable
   of video-communication, living with someone, living in a care home,
   weekly online banking usage, and perceived familiarity with virtual
   platforms. Conclusion Caregivers and patients indicated a high level of
   acceptance of virtual medical consultations, which is likely facilitated
   by caregivers such as adult children or spouses at home or staff in care
   homes. To minimize the transmission of COVID-19 in a highly vulnerable
   group, virtual consultations are an acceptable alternative to
   face-to-face consultations for older people and their caregivers in our
   setting.

   public health emergency by the World Health Organization and activated
   response teams at almost all Malaysian healthcare facilities. Upon
   activation of the National Crisis Preparedness and Response Center in
   January 2020, the National Institutes of Health Malaysia established a
   COVID-19 operation room at the facility level to address the rise in
   COVID-19 infection cases each day. The National Institutes of Health
   COVID-19 operation room committee formed a workforce mobilization team
   for an effective and efficient mobilization system to fulfill requests
   received for human resource aid within the Ministry of Health Malaysia
   facilities. Selected personnel would be screened for health and
   availability before mobilization letters and logistics arrangements if
   necessary. The workforce from the National Institutes of Health,
   consisting of various job positions, were mobilized every week, with
   each deployment cycle lasting 2 weeks. A total of 128 personnel from the
   six institutes under the National Institutes of Health were mobilized:
   tasks included fever screening, active case detection, health management
   at quarantine centers, and management of dead bodies. A well-organized
   data management system with a centralized online system integration
   could allow more rapid deployment and answer some of the key questions
   in managing a similar pandemic in the future. With improving infected
   COVID-19 cases throughout the country, the National Institutes of Health
   COVID-19 operation room was effectively closed on June 15, 2020,
   following approval from the Deputy Director-General of Health.

   impacted the whole world in every aspect including health, social life,
   economic activity, education, and the environment. The pandemic has led
   to an improvement in air quality all around the world, including in
   Malaysia. Lockdowns have resulted in industry shutting down and road
   travel decreasing which can reduce the emission of Greenhouse Gases
   (GHG) and air pollution. This research assesses the impact of the
   COVID-19 lockdown on emissions using the Air Pollution Index (API),
   aerosols, and GHG which is Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in Malaysia. The data
   used is from Sentinel-5p and Sentinel-2A which monitor the air quality
   based on Ozone (O-3) and NO2 concentration. Using an interpolated API
   Index Map comparing 2019, before the implementation of a Movement
   Control Order (MCO), and 2020, after the MCO period we examine the
   impact on pollution during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Data used
   Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-2A, and Air Pollution Index of Malaysia (APIMS) to
   monitor the air quality that contains NO2 concentration. The result has
   shown the recovery in air quality during the MCO implementation which
   indirectly shows anthropogenic activities towards the environmental
   condition. The study will help to enhance and support the policy and
   scope for air pollution management strategies as well as raise public
   awareness of the main causes that contribute to air pollution.

AB IntroductionIn the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline
   healthcare providers who are engaged in the direct diagnosis, treatment,
   and care of patients face a high risk of infection and inadequate
   protection from contamination, overwork, frustration, and exhaustion.
   These impose significant psychological and mental health concerns for
   frontline healthcare providers. ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore
   the experiences and challenges faced and coping strategies adopted by
   frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in
   Kelantan, Malaysia. MethodologyThis phenomenological approach to
   qualitative study used a telephone-based in-depth interview that
   followed a semistructured interview guide. The number of frontline
   healthcare providers was based on saturation theory. All the
   participants recruited fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria
   from May to July 2020 in Raja Perempuan Zainab II Hospital. All
   interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic data
   analysis using NVIVO version 10 was performed. ResultThe 10 respondents
   involved in this study consisted of doctors, medical assistants, and
   nurses. The findings were divided into four main themes: invaluable
   experiences during the pandemic, challenges, coping strategies, and
   future expectations. The providers responded well in facing the disease
   even though they felt psychologically disturbed at the initial phase of
   the COVID-19 pandemic. ConclusionHealthcare providers perceived
   themselves as being more resilient and less vulnerable to psychological
   impacts than they were before the pandemic.

AB Countries around the world are gearing for the transition of the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from pandemic to endemic phase but
   the emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2) variants could lead to a prolonged pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 has
   continued to evolve as it optimizes its adaptation to the human host and
   the successive waves of COVID-19 have been linked to the explosion of
   particular variant of concern. As the genetic diversity and
   epidemiological landscape of SARS-CoV-2 differ from country to country,
   this study aims to provide insights into the variants that are
   circulating in Malaysia. Whole genome sequencing was performed for 204
   SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 cases and an additional 18,667 SARS-CoV-2
   genome sequences were retrieved from the GISAID EpiCoV database for
   clade, lineage and genetic variation analyses. Complete genome sequences
   with high coverage were then used for phylogeny investigation and the
   resulting phylogenetic tree was constructed from 8,716 sequences. We
   found that the different waves of COVID-19 in Malaysia were dominated by
   different clades with the L and O clade for first and second wave,
   respectively, whereas the progressive replacement by G, GH, and GK of
   the GRA clade were observed in the subsequence waves. Continuous
   monitoring of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is important to
   identify the emergence and dominance of new variant in different
   locality so that the appropriate countermeasures can be taken to
   effectively contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

AB Aim Households are a significant venue for the transmission of
   SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a study to characterise the transmission
   dynamics and identify risk factors for household transmission of
   SARS-CoV-2 in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Methods This retrospective
   observational study included 185 families of paediatric COVID-19 cases
   from 1 February 2020 to 31 December 2020. We identified the index case
   for each household and gathered the socio-demographic, epidemiological
   investigation results and risk factors for household transmission from
   medical case records. The secondary attack rate was calculated, and
   logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors
   associated with secondary household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Results
   Of the 848 household contacts, 466 acquired secondary infections,
   resulting in a secondary attack rate of 55%. The median age of the
   secondary cases was 12 years. Female household contacts and household
   contacts who slept in the same room with the index case were
   significantly associated with increased risk for COVID-19. Other
   independent risk factors associated with higher transmission risk in the
   household included an index case who was symptomatic, a household index
   case aged greater than 18 years and a male household index case.
   Conclusions High rates of household transmission of COVID-19 were found,
   indicating households were a major setting of transmission of
   SARS-CoV-2. Our data provide insight into the risk factors for household
   transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia.

AB This study investigates the underlying motives for online fake news
   sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented time that
   witnessed a spike in the spread of false content. Motives were
   identified based on a fake news sharing model developed using the
   SocioCultural-Psychological-Technology (SCulPT) model, Uses and
   Gratification (U&G) theory and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), and
   further extended using fake news predictors/gratifications from past
   studies. A self-administered survey resulted in 869 online Malaysian
   respondents aged between 18 and 59 years old (Mean = 22.6, Standard
   deviation = 6.13). Structured equation modelling revealed the fake news
   sharing model to collectively account for 49.2 % of the variance, with
   Altruism (13 = 0.333; p < 0.001), Ignorance (13 = 0.165; p < 0.001) and
   Entertainment (13 = 0.139; p < 0.001) significantly predicting the
   behaviour. Conversely, Availability/Effort, Pass Time and Fear of
   Missing Out were found to be insignificant. Our findings indicate that
   fake news sharing behavior is determined by different motives, hence
   these need to be understood in order to develop better solutions to
   mitigate this problem.

AB Objective: This study has been done to assess Malaysia's effectiveness
   in handling COVID-19 compared to other countries in South East Asia.
   Methods: Stochastic Frontier Analysis is capable of compiling the
   effectiveness of dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks according to its
   function and not using a specific distribution function. The highest
   technical efficiency score is the most efficient and reflects the
   ability of the country to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, which is very
   well without any problems. Results: Thailand was shown to be ranked 1
   (TE = 0.88341) with a technical efficiency score higher than most other
   countries. The score for second place is Malaysia with a technical
   efficiency score of TE = 0.88338, the third place score is Indonesia (TE
   = 0.83342) and last position is Philippine (TE = 0.67706).
   Conclusions: Ministry of Health took the implementation of MCO, and
   action did put Malaysia as the second most effective country in
   Southeast Asia in managing COVID-19 infection. This data hopefully,
   could benefit Malaysia and all other countries to handle this COVID-19
   epidemic.

AB This cross-sectional study aims to investigate physical activity,
   self-regulation in eating behaviour, and their associations with body
   weight trajectory during the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown (Movement
   Control Order, MCO) in Malaysia. The International Physical Activity
   Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to assess physical activity
   and sitting time during the MCO. Self-regulation in eating behaviour was
   evaluated with the Self-Regulation of Eating Behaviour Questionnaire
   (SREBQ), while weight trajectory was self-reported by the respondents.
   Of the 200 young adults, 82.0% were reported to be physically active
   during the MCO, with a weekly physical activity intensity of 4551.16 +/-
   4744.89 MET-minute. Young adults in this study spent 8.63 +/- 4.47
   hours/day on sedentary activities during the MCO. It is also noted that
   the majority (71.0%) had medium self-regulation in eating behaviour
   during the lockdown, with a mean score of 3.08 +/- 0.49. Slightly more
   than half of the young adults (57.0%) gained weight since the MCO
   enforcement, with an average weight increment of 1.28 +/- 0.60 kg.
   Findings from the multinomial logistic regression suggested that
   self-regulation in eating behaviour was a significant predictor for
   weight trajectory during the MCO. Young adults who attained a higher
   score in SREBQ were more likely in sustained weight (AOR = 2.514, p =
   0.024, CI: 1.129-5.597) and weight loss (AOR = 2.624, p = 0.011, CI:
   1.250-5.507) categories. In conclusion, poor response to food cues (poor
   self-regulation in eating behaviour), but not physical inactivity, led
   to weight gain during the MCO in Malaysia.

AB INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major impact to global
   public health including one of the high risk groups which is the medical
   students. This study was intended to assess knowledge, attitudes and
   practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 among medical students in International
   Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). MATERIAL AND METHOD: An online
   cross-sectional study was conducted among 438 medical students of IIUM
   from 6th July 2020 to 9th July 2020. KAP towards COVID-19 was measured
   using a structured Malay and English version questionnaire consisting of
   13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices.
   RESULTS: The average correct response rate on knowledge was 85.4%. Only
   12.1% of the students had correct knowledge on all items, and 1 in every
   4 and 5 students had misconceptions on the clinical features and
   transmission of COVID-19. In term of attitudes towards COVID-19,
   majority of the respondents believed that COVID-19 would be effectively
   controlled (85%) and had faith that Malaysia could overcome the war
   against COVID-19 (99%). Most of the respondents practiced good towards
   COVID-19 in avoiding crowded places (90%), wearing face masks (95%) and
   practicing hand hygiene (91.6%). CONCLUSION: Although the results are
   positive towards KAP, only 1 in every 10 students responded correctly to
   all knowledge questions, and few proportions had misconceptions on the
   disease and did not maintain adequate practices. Policies aimed at
   appropriate health promotion activities may ensure empowering the
   medical students with adequate knowledge on all aspects of COVID-19, and
   practice properly following the standard operating procedure implemented
   by the government.

AB Introduction Medical schools throughout the world were forced to modify
   their programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Malaysia, virtual
   learning plans were implemented for non-clinical programming, while
   clinical posting modifications were designed to meet local SOPs. The
   prolonged enforcement of these modifications to undergraduate medical
   education will have affected student experiences, including well-being.
   Since these feelings can relate to perceived relatedness, autonomy, and
   competence, it is important to identify any potential factors that may
   lead to reduced intrinsic motivation in students. It is also important
   to consider how demographic features may contribute to student
   perspectives, which can be studied using the unique diversity
   represented by Malaysian students. Methods A quantitative survey was
   distributed to Malaysian medical students to assess their overall
   wellbeing, autonomy in educational decision making, student experiences,
   and position on changes to graduation timing. Intrinsic components were
   identified using Principal Component Analysis and were aligned with the
   three needs for self-determination, namely relatedness, autonomy, and
   competence. Finally, trends in responses for participants from various
   sub-populations were assessed using ANOVA testing. Results Responses
   were collected from 442 students representing 23 accredited Malaysian
   medical schools. Upon validation and reliability testing, eight
   components were identified with themes relating to: mental health,
   social concerns, communication, timing of modifications, depth of
   learning, and student-centred learning. Of these, gender was related to
   mental health, student-centred learning, and delayed graduation, while
   stage was related to student-centred learning and delayed graduation in
   addition to concerns about depth of learning and timing of
   modifications. Interestingly, ethnicity was related to differences in
   opinions about delayed graduation and income was related to social
   concerns. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that, while
   students were satisfied in general with the content and delivery of
   their programmes given the circumstances, there is evidence to suggest
   negative effects on emotional wellbeing and expression of student voice,
   due to the modifications that were made. Additionally, these feelings
   related to the three motivational needs, suggesting that students were
   experiencing a dampened motivational profile during the pandemic.
   Further, motivational profiles were distinct between student sub-groups,
   providing insight for developing appropriate and inclusive
   accommodations moving forward.

AB BackgroundMisinformation has had a negative impact upon the global
   COVID-19 vaccination program. High-income and middle-income earners
   typically have better access to technology and health facilities than
   those in lower-income groups. This creates a rich-poor divide in Digital
   Health Literacy (DHL), where low-income earners have low DHL resulting
   in higher COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, this cross-sectional
   study was undertaken to assess the impact of health information seeking
   behavior on digital health literacy related to COVID-19 among low-income
   earners in Selangor, Malaysia. MethodsA quantitative cross-sectional
   study was conducted conveniently among 381 individuals from the
   low-income group in Selangor, Malaysia. The remote data collection (RDC)
   method was used to gather data. Validated interviewer-rated
   questionnaires were used to collect data via phone call. Respondents
   included in the study were 18 years and older. A normality of numerical
   variables were assessed using Shapiro-Wilk test. Univariate analysis of
   all variables was performed, and results were presented as means, mean
   ranks, frequencies, and percentages. Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal
   Wallis H test was applied for the comparison of DHL and health
   information seeking behavior with characteristics of the participants.
   Multivariate linear regression models were applied using DHL as
   dependent variable and health information seeking behavior as
   independent factors, adjusting for age, gender, marital status,
   educational status, employment status, and household income. ResultsThe
   mean age of the study participants was 38.16 +/- 14.40 years ranging
   from 18 to 84 years. The vast majority (94.6%) of participants stated
   that information seeking regarding COVID-19 was easy or very easy.
   Around 7 percent of the respondents cited reading information about
   COVID-19 on the internet as very difficult. The higher mean rank of DHL
   search, content, reliability, relevance, and privacy was found among
   participants who were widowed, had primary education, or unemployed. An
   inverse relationship was found between overall DHL and confidence in the
   accuracy of the information on the internet regarding COVID-19 (beta =
   -2.01, 95% CI = -2.22 to -1.79). ConclusionIt is important to provide
   support to lower-income demographics to assist access to high-quality
   health information, including less educated, unemployed, and widowed
   populations. This can improve overall DHL.

AB The restriction of daily and economic-related activities due to COVID-19
   pandemic via lockdown order has been reported to improve air quality.
   This study evaluated temporal and spatial variations of four major air
   pollutant concentrations across Malaysia before (March 4, 2020-March 17,
   2020) and during the implementation of different phases of Movement
   Control Order (MCO) (March 18, 2020-May 12, 2020) from 65 official
   regulatory air quality stations. Results showed that restriction in
   daily and economic activities has remarkably reduced the air quality in
   all sub-urban, urban, and industrial settings with relatively small
   contributions from meteorological conditions. Overall, compared to
   before MCO, average concentrations of PM2.5, CO, and NO2 reduced by
   23.1%, 21.74%, and 54.0%, respectively, while that of SO2 was constant.
   The highest reduction of PM2.5, CO, and NO2 were observed in stations
   located in urban setting, where 63% stations showed significant
   reduction (p < 0.05) for PM2.5 and CO, while all stations showed
   significant reduction in NO2 concentrations. It was also revealed that
   70.5% stations recorded lower concentrations of PM2.5 during MCO
   compared to before MCO, despite that high numbers of local hotspots were
   observed simultaneously from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Spatial analysis showed that the northern
   part of Peninsular had the highest significant reduction of PM2.5, while
   the highest of NO2 and CO reduction were found in stations located in
   the central region. All pollutants exhibit similar diurnal trends when
   compared between pre- and during MCO although significant lower readings
   were observed during MCO. This study gives confidence to regulatory
   body; the enforcement of strict air pollution prevention and control
   policies could help in reducing pollution.

AB Objective: To evaluate the perceptions of undergraduate pharmacy
   students towards online assessments used during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using a
   self-administered, validated and pre-tested online questionnaire. The
   data were collected from December 2020 to January 2021 and analysed
   using descriptive and inferential tests. Results: Of the 233 respondents
   (response rate: 72%), approximately 45% strongly disagree or disagree
   that online assessment is better than the conventional method of
   assessment. Only 23.6% were very satisfied or satisfied with online
   assessment, while 28.8% were very dissatisfied or dissatisfied. About
   80% experienced problems with online assessment including failure of
   portal/online server (63.5%), slow or failure of internet connection
   (45.5%) and a problem with laptop/gadget (40.8%). Females, final year
   students, and those who have access to very fast internet speed had
   significantly better perceptions towards online assessment. Conclusion:
   Undergraduate pharmacy students have negative perceptions towards online
   assessment used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the students
   experienced difficulties with online assessment and this may affect
   their performances. The challenges identified should be addressed in
   order to improve the use of online assessment in the future.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people in many ways, including mental
   health status. Depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) are terms often
   used to describe mental health status worldwide. The present study
   describes the prevalence of DAS and its associated factors among
   healthcare workers (HCWs) in the northwest region of Malaysia, during
   the early phase of recovery of movement control order (RMCO), where some
   restrictions were lifted, and cases are reducing in number. This
   cross-sectional study used HCW's mental health surveillance data using
   the DASS-21 questionnaire. A total of 981 data collected between 1 July
   and 31 August 2020 were randomly sampled. Socio-demographic factors,
   occupational characteristics, and health backgrounds were extracted and
   analyzed using multiple logistic regression. The prevalences of DAS are
   8.4% (6.7, 10.3), 17.1% (14.8, 19.6), and 6.4% (5.0, 8.1), respectively.
   Age is significantly associated with depression (Adjusted Odd Ratio
   (Adj.OR) 0.96 (0.93, 0.99)) and stress (Adj.OR 0.96 (0.93, 0.997)).
   Working at the hospital is associated with depression (Adj.OR 1.88
   (1.19, 2.97)) as well as anxiety (Adj.OR 1.91 (1.36, 2.68). HCWs with a
   degree or postgraduate education level are more stressed compared to
   those with lower educational levels (Adj.OR 8.43 (1.95, 36.37)). Mental
   health surveillance helps to identify those at risk. Those younger in
   age, working in hospitals, and with more responsibility in management
   are the most affected. With the easing of COVID-19 pandemic
   restrictions, which lead to the release of certain movement control, the
   mental health status of HCWs was less affected. Those working directly
   with COVID-19 patients and with more responsibility in management are
   the most affected.

AB SARS-CoV-2, known as COVID-19, has affected the entire world, resulting
   in an unexpected death rate as compared to the death probability before
   the pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, death probability has been
   assessed in a normal context that is different from those anticipated
   during the pandemic, particularly for the older population cluster.
   However, there is no such evidence of excess mortality in Malaysia to
   date. Therefore, this study determines the excess mortality rate for
   specific age groups during the pandemic outbreak in Malaysia. Before
   determining the excess mortality rate, this study aims to establish the
   efficiency of various parametrized mortality models in reference to the
   data set before the pandemic. This study employs the hold-out, repeated
   hold-out, and leave-one-out cross-validation procedures to identify the
   optimal mortality law for fitting the mortality data. Based on the
   goodness-of-fit measures (mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute
   error, sum square error, and mean square error), the Heligman-Pollard
   model for men and Rogers Planck model for women are considered as the
   optimal models. In assessing the excess mortality, both models favour
   the hold-out technique. When the COVID-19 mortality data are
   incorporated to forecast the mortality rate for people aged 60 and
   above, there is an excess mortality rate. However, the men's mortality
   rate appears to be delayed and more prolonged than the women's mortality
   rate. Consequently, the government is recommended to amend the existing
   policy to reflect the post COVID-19 mortality forecast.

AB The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the economy of the
   world as well as the construction industry in Malaysia. Many projects
   were plagued with time and cost overruns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Site work progress came to an abrupt halt, and productivity stagnated.
   With that in mind, this study was conducted on the basis of first-hand
   experience in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and how it has affected
   the construction industry. This study investigated the effects of the
   COVID-19 pandemic on construction projects in Sarawak, Malaysia. The
   target respondents were the clients, consultants, and contractors
   involved in projects under the purview of the Public Works Department
   Sarawak. The purpose of the research was to obtain a better
   understanding of the current situation, in readiness for a similar
   situation in future. To achieve the objectives of the research, a
   questionnaire survey of current ongoing projects was used for this
   study's data collection purpose. To analyse the data, SPSS version 26
   and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method were used to achieve
   frequency analysis and to determine the priority importance of the
   effects of this pandemic on those construction projects. The findings of
   this study provide necessary information to construction stakeholders in
   Sarawak on how to deal with such pandemics in the future and to create
   awareness, foster resiliency, connote preventive measures, avert delays,
   and manage progress control.

AB Previous pandemics have demonstrated short and long-term impacts on
   healthcare workers' mental health, causing knock-on effects on patient
   care and professional functioning. Indeed, the present COVID-19 pandemic
   has created unprecedented disruption in social interactions and working
   conditions. Malaysia has been under the Recovery Movement Control Order
   since June 2020; however, with the upsurge of cases, healthcare workers
   face pressure not only from working in resource-deprived settings but
   also from the increasing patient load. The primary objective of the
   present study was to examine the cross-sectional relationship of
   COVID-19 fear and stress to psychological distress (operationalized as
   anxiety and depression) in healthcare workers. The present sample
   included 286 frontline healthcare workers from three hospitals in
   Selangor, Malaysia. Self-administered questionnaires containing
   sociodemographic and occupational items, the Malay versions of the
   Coronavirus Stress Measure scale, the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, the
   Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9
   were distributed via online platforms. Hierarchical multiple regression
   findings suggest that age, shift work, and COVID-19 stress consistently
   predicted anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers
   after adjusting for sociodemographic and occupational variables. The
   present findings suggest that frontline healthcare workers are not only
   inoculated against COVID-19 itself but also against the psychological
   sequelae of the pandemic.

   institutions are not spared of this disruption. Conventional teaching
   methods are now being replaced by non-conventional modes of teaching,
   which include online teaching and assessment using various platforms
   such as Zoom, WebEx and others. In embarking on online methods of
   teaching, social work educators will have to undergo many changes. It is
   particularly so as social work has a practice component that involves
   field training, which will be a different challenge to educators and
   students in this new and unexpected environment. This paper aims to
   discuss the implications of COVID-19 on the changes that have taken

AB Purpose: Once COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December
   2019, it has rapidly spread worldwide. The Malaysian Government had
   taken an early measure by introducing the movement control order (MCO),
   which is a form of lockdown. This study aims at describing the referral
   pattern for urology in a COVID-19 designated tertiary hospital
   throughout the MCO period. Materials and Methods: All urology referrals
   received from March 18, 2020 to April 28, 2020 (i.e., during the MCO
   period) were included and assessed prospectively. For comparison, a
   retrospective study covering the period from February 1, 2020 to March
   17, 2020 (i.e. pre-MCO period) was conducted. Parameters measured and
   compared include sources of referral, type of cases, outcomes, admission
   status, and COVID-19 status of patients referred. Results: The majority
   of referrals for urology were received from the emergency department
   during MCO (42.9%), followed by the medical ward (28.6%) and surgical
   ward (2.3%). In terms of the type of cases referred, during the MCO, the
   highest number of hematuria cases (22.5%) was received and a high number
   of Benign Prostate Hypertrophy (BPH) and urethral stricture cases
   (18.8%). Conservative measures remain the most commonly adopted
   outcomes/management for both pre and during MCO. The number of
   admissions required for urology referral showed a slight difference
   between pre and during MCO. Conclusion: The workload of urology referral
   in a COVID-19 designated tertiary hospital did not change despite MCO.
   This supports that the urology team still has an important role to play
   as a subspecialty unit in managing urology emergencies, even when
   elective surgeries and procedures are being reduced or rescheduled.

AB Objective: This study aims to investigate the association between
   smoking and the severity of COVID-19 infection during the initial wave
   of this pandemic in Malaysia.
   Methods: This is a multi-center observational study using secondary
   hospital data collected retrospectively from February 1, 2020, until May
   30, 2020. Clinical records of all real-time polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 cases with smoking status, co-morbidities,
   clinical features, and disease management were retrieved. Severity was
   assessed by the presence of complications and outcomes of COVID-19
   infection. Logistic regression was used to determine the association
   between COVID-19 disease severity and smoking status.
   Results: A total of 5,889 COVID-19 cases were included in the analysis.
   Ever smokers had a higher risk of having COVID-19 complications, such as
   acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds ratio [OR] 1.69; 95%
   confidence interval [CI] 1.09-2.55), renal injury (OR 1.55; 95% CI
   1.10-2.14), and acute liver injury (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.01-1.74), compared
   with never smokers. However, in terms of disease outcomes, there were no
   differences between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Although no significant association was found in terms of
   disease outcomes, smoking is associated with a higher risk of having
   complications owing to COVID-19 infection. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

   acceleration of e-commerce, initiatives taken by the government, and the
   modern payment system in Malaysia, cash remains the prevalent payment
   method. Hence, this study investigates how the coronavirus disease
   (COVID-19) crisis influenced consumers' perceptions and determines
   factors contributing to consumers' behavioural intention to use cashless
   payment. The research framework for this study is based on the unified
   theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The study collected
   a total of 463 responses from the online survey. The data of this study
   were analysed using partial least square modelling techniques. This
   study demonstrates that the crisis significantly and positively
   influences consumers' perceptions of performance expectancy, effort
   expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. All of these
   factors explain consumers' behavioural intention to use cashless
   payment, except facilitating conditions. The findings acknowledge the
   impact of the health crisis on consumer perceptions and influence their

   portrayals of the various state machinery figures both from the
   government and opposition sides (i.e., ministers, politicians and
   government officers) in their roles in combating COVID-19. Additionally,
   the analysis wishes to uncover contemporary attitudes Ng uses such as
   symbolism, exaggeration and irony, among others, to convey his views on
   the current issue in obvious and subtle ways. In analysing the data,
   this study employed data analysis techniques in the form of descriptive
   content analysis. It was found that the social commentaries presented in
   Ng's comics via the plot depict the existence of sexism, unfair
   treatment, and prejudice by several characters which lead to bully
   culture in the midst of the political metaphorical depiction of war and
   heroism among Malaysian state machinery figures. The images in his
   comics help people analyse, reflect on, and interpret our experiences by
   informing, providing meaning, and illustrating the COVID19 outbreak
   narrative.

AB Purpose Studies have shown that managing household solid waste from
   low-cost housing in urban and sub-urban communities is challenging,
   especially in developing countries and COVID-19 era. Previous research
   proved that the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies could be
   engaged to improve urban public services such as household solid waste.
   Thus, the study investigated 4IR role in improving low-cost housing
   solid waste management (LCHSWM) in the COVID-19 era across Malaysia's
   cities. Design/methodology/approach The researchers selected four
   Malaysian cities (Pulau Pinang, Kuala Lumpur, Kuching and Putrajaya) to
   achieve the study's objectives via a qualitative research design. The
   study engaged forty experts through semi-structured virtual interviews.
   A thematic approach was used to analyse the collected data. Findings
   Findings identified initial high implementation and maintenance costs,
   unwillingness to accept change, inadequate knowledge and skilled
   personnel to manage the operation, amongst others, as the perceived
   challenges facing 4IR technologies in managing low-cost housing solid
   waste across Malaysian cities in the COVID-19 era. Also, the study
   proffered measures to improve 4IR technologies usage. Research
   limitations/implications This paper is limited to the perceived
   contributory challenges and proffered measures to improve 4IR
   technologies usage in managing LCHSW across Malaysian cities in the
   COVID-19 era. Practical implications Proffered measures will stir
   policymakers and the political class (city councils) to start thinking
   of an all-inclusive approach to addressing the issue of LCHSW in the
   21st century. As part of the practical implications, the possible
   outcome might enhance collaboration between the public and private
   sectors to better service delivery to mitigate environmental
   degradation. Originality/value As revealed in the review, there is a
   paucity of literature regarding digital technology's roles in mitigating
   LCHSW across Malaysian cities in the COVID-19 era.

AB Malaysia has seen the third wave of infection since the start of the
   global COVID-19 pandemic, with approximately 103 construction sites
   involving over 14,677 workers reported from April 2020 to February 2021.
   This has led to limited progress in construction projects or a complete
   halt, resulting in late project delivery. The purpose of this paper is
   to investigate the factors influencing the spread of COVID-19 and the
   strategies taken by the affected construction sites to mitigate the
   spread of the outbreak. The researchers adopted a case study approach
   with a multiple-case design and discusses the use of an in-depth
   interviewing method to collect rich data on the studied phenomenon. Data
   collected from three construction sites. The sites were mixed
   development projects in nature and provided in-depth, rigorous, and
   robust information. Based on the results, two categories of factors
   influencing the spread of COVID-19 were established. These are primary
   and secondary factors, such as workers' mobilisation, uncontrolled
   movement of workers, and the limited practice of social distancing.
   Furthermore, evidence suggests that the strategies adopted to control
   the effects of the pandemic were a combination of government enforcement
   and initiatives taken by construction companies. This paper concludes
   that an early identification of the causes of the spread will enable
   appropriate implementation strategies to control the outbreak. This
   study is an attempt to present the experiences of one developing country
   as an example of a means of dealing with unexpected pandemics or other
   intractable diseases that can affect project delivery.

AB Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic placed an unprecedented overload on
   healthcare system globally. With all medical resources being dedicated
   to contain the spread of the disease, the pandemic may have impacted the
   burden of other infectious diseases such as dengue, particularly in
   countries endemic for dengue fever. Indeed, the co-occurrence of
   COVID-19 made dengue diagnosis challenging because of some shared
   clinical manifestations between the two pathogens. Furthermore, the
   sudden emergence and novelty of this global public health crisis has
   forced the suspension or slow-down of several research trials due to the
   lack of sufficient knowledge on how to handle the continuity of research
   trials during the pandemic. We report on challenges we have faced during
   the COVID-19 pandemic and measures that were implemented to continue the
   iDEM project (intervention for Dengue Epidemiology in Malaysia).
   Methods: This randomized controlled trial aims to assess the
   effectiveness of Integrated Vector Management (IVM) on the incidence of
   dengue in urban Malaysia by combining: targeted outdoor residual
   spraying (TORS), deployment of auto-dissemination devices (ADDs), and
   active community engagement (CE). Our operational activities started on
   February 10, 2020, a few weeks before the implementation of
   non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of COVID-19 in
   Malaysia.
   Results: The three main issues affecting the continuity of the trial
   were: ensuring the safety of field workers during the interventions;
   ensuring the planned turnover of TORS application and ADD deployment and
   services; and maintaining the CE activities as far as possible.
   Conclusions: Even though the pandemic has created monumental challenges,
   we ensured the safety of field workers by providing complete personal
   protective equipment and regular COVID-19 testing. Albeit with delay, we
   maintained the planned interval time between TORS application and ADDs
   services by overlapping the intervention cycles instead of having them
   in a sequential scheme. CE activities continued remotely through several
   channels (e.g., phone calls and text messages). Sustained efforts of the
   management team, significant involvement of the Malaysian Ministry of
   Health and a quick and smart adaptation of the trial organisation
   according to the pandemic situation were the main factors that allowed
   the successful continuation of our research.

AB Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had both positive and negative
   impacts on humans and the environment. In general, a positive impact can
   be seen on the environment, especially in regard to air quality. This
   positive impact on air quality around the world is a result of movement
   control orders (MCO) or lockdowns, which were carried out to reduce the
   cases of COVID-19 around the world. Nevertheless, data on the effects on
   air quality both during and post lockdown at local scales are still
   sparse. Here, we investigate changes in air quality during normal days,
   the MCOs (MCO 1, 2 and 3) and post MCOs, namely the Conditional Movement
   Control Order (CMCO) and the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) in
   the Klang Valley region. In this study, we used the air sensor network
   AiRBOXSense that measures carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
   sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) at Petaling
   Jaya South (PJS), Kelana Jaya (KJ) and Kota Damansara (KD). The results
   showed that the daily average concentrations of CO and NO2 mostly
   decreased in the order of normal days > MCO (MCO 1, 2 and 3) > CMCO >
   RMCO. PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and O-3 showed a decrease from the MCO to RMCO.
   PJS showed that air pollutant concentrations decreased from normal days
   to the lockdown phases. This clearly shows the effects of 'work from
   home' orders at all places in the PJS city. The greatest percentage
   reductions in air pollutants were observed during the change from normal
   days to MCO 1 (24% to 64%), while during MCO 1 to MCO 2, the
   concentrations were slightly increased during the changes of the
   lockdown phase, except for SO2 and NO2 over PJS. In KJ, most of the air
   pollutants decreased from MCO 1 to MCO 3 except for CO. However, the
   percentage reduction and increments of the gas pollutants were not
   consistent during the different phases of lockdown, and this effect was
   due to the sensor location-only 20 m from the main highway (vehicle
   emissions). The patterns of air pollutant concentrations over the KD
   site were similar to the PJS site; however, the percentage reduction and
   increases of PM2.5, O-3, SO2 and CO were not consistent. We believe that
   local burning was the main contribution to these unstable patterns
   during the lockdown period. The cause of these different changes in
   concentrations may be due to the relaxation phases during the lockdown
   at each station, where most of the common activities, such as commuting
   and industrial activities changed in frequency from the MCO, CMCO and
   RMCO. Wind direction also affected the concentrations, for example,
   during the CMCO and RMCO, most of the pollutants were blowing in from
   the Southeast region, which mostly consists of a city center and
   industrial areas. There was a weak correlation between air pollutants
   and the temperature and relative humidity at all stations. Health risk
   assessment analysis showed that non-carcinogenic risk health quotient
   (HQ) values for the pollutants at all stations were less than 1,
   suggesting unlikely non-carcinogenic effects, except for SO2 (HQ > 1) in
   KJ. The air quality information showed that reductions in air pollutants
   can be achieved if traffic and industry emissions are strictly
   controlled.</p>

AB Herbal and dietary supplements (HDSs) are frequently obtained from
   community pharmacies, but community pharmacists (CPs) have been
   underutilized for information regarding them. This study aimed to
   determine the prevalence of, factors behind, and reasons for
   consultation with CPs among HDS consumers in Malaysia. A cross-sectional
   study using an online survey was conducted among conveniently sampled
   individuals in Malaysia. Reasons for consultation or non-consultation
   with CPs about HDSs were sought from the respondents. A logistic
   regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of
   consultation with CPs. Overall, 40.3% (239/593) of participants
   consulted CPs about the HDSs that they purchased. The participants were
   predominantly unmarried (362/588, 61.6%) and belonged to the 18-29 age
   group (332/593, 56%). The multivariate analysis showed that a suburban
   residential setting was the only significant predictor for consultation
   with CPs (adjusted odds ratio = 0.390, 95% CI = 0.260-0.583).
   Respondents who consulted CPs generally agreed that the CPs were the
   right people to consult on HDSs (mean = 4.37, SD = 0.73). However, their
   discussion with CPs regarding HDSs mostly revolved around the benefits
   and directions for use, but little on the potential risks. Meanwhile,
   most respondents who did not consult CPs agreed that they had never
   thought of consulting CPs about their HDS use (mean = 3.45, SD = 1.02).
   The majority of them referred to the Internet (61.3%, 217/354) and
   social media (59.9%, 212/354) for information about HDSs. The findings
   from this study show that more efforts are warranted in encouraging
   consumers to consult CPs about their HDS use and to enhance their
   awareness of the roles of CPs in ensuring the safe use of HDSs.

AB Although the global crude oil market plays a significant role in pricing
   edible oils, the association between energy price uncertainty and the
   Malaysian palm oil industry remains understudied. Given that palm oil is
   widely used as a cheap feedstock for biodiesel, it is important to
   investigate whether risk transmits from the oil market to the Malaysian
   palm oil industry. Employing GARCH-jump models, this study extends the
   scant literature. The results reveal that the crude oil volatility index
   (OVX) significantly influences palm oil prices suggesting that an upturn
   in oil market volatility negatively impacts palm oil prices. Subsample
   analyses show that the negative impact of OVX intensified during the
   2014 oil price decline and the COVID-19 outbreak. The effect of OVX is
   asymmetric, implying that changes (upward and downward shifts) in oil
   price variance exert a heterogeneous impact on the price levels of this
   edible oil. It is also observed that palm oil prices experience
   time-dependent jumps. We show that volatility significantly transfers
   from the crude oil to the palm oil market during periods of high
   uncertainty. Hence, investors and policymakers could use the information
   content of OVX for forecasting future trends in palm oil prices.

AB Introduction: COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude and practice plays a
   major role in determining the readiness of the community to adopt the
   behavioural change towards recommended preventive measures outlined by
   public health officials. This study aims to assess the knowledge,
   attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19 among university students as
   well as its associated factors.
   Design and methods: This is a cross sectional study that was conducted
   among students in a public university during the early phase of COVID-19
   pandemic in Malaysia. An online validated self-administered
   questionnaire was used to collect the data. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal
   Wallis test was used to determine the association between independent
   variables with knowledge, attitude, and practice score.
   Results: Overall response rate of this study was 92.9 (n=524). Median
   score of knowledge domain was 78.0 (IQR= +/- 12.0) median attitude score
   of 49.0 (IQR - +/- 5.0), and median practice score of 80.0 (IQR= +/-
   11.0). The mean knowledge, attitude and practice score were
   significantly higher among diploma holder (vs degree holder, p<0.05),
   residing in main Kota Kinabalu campus (vs non-KK campus, p<0.001),
   studying in medical faculty (vs non-medical faculty, p<0.001), and
   attended COVID-19 education (vs non-attendance; p<0.05).
   Conclusion: COVID-19 related knowledge and attitude were below
   satisfactory level during earlier phase of the pandemic. However,
   majority of respondents have positive behaviour towards COVID-19
   prevention. This highlights the importance of accurate and tailored
   health education to improve the level of knowledge, attitude and
   practice of recommended measures to prevent COVID-19 spread.

AB The property sector is revitalised to incorporate sustainability,
   specifically the biophilic design, to encourage human interaction with
   nature. Thus, there is an urgent need to communicate the biophilic
   design elements amongst stakeholders, especially the foreign workers, to
   ensure the project meets the requirement. However, standard project
   communications management is no longer practical, as the construction
   industry worldwide has been severely impacted by the Coronavirus Disease
   2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hence, this paper evaluates the biophilic
   design elements to be communicated and examines the project
   communications management breakdown relating to the biophilic design
   elements in the Malaysian construction industry during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), focus group
   discussion (FGD) and questionnaire survey on 147 foreign workers, this
   paper found that from 33 biophilic design element items, only 1 item is
   categorised as highly critical, whereas another 20 items are categorised
   as critical. In addition, 43 potential communications management
   breakdown items from a total of 66 items fall under the critical
   category. The finding suggests that communication breakdown is caused by
   the language barrier amongst foreign workers from different ethnicities
   as well as between foreign workers and the supervisors, since face to
   face communication is limited during the pandemic.

AB Objective: To determine the degree of knowledge in the usage of pulse
   oximeter as a home assessment tool among the community in Malaysia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in November 2021. The
   questionnaire assessed the knowledge in using pulse oximeters, user
   experience and opinions in using pulse oximeter as a home assessment
   tool during the pandemic.
   Results: A total of 504 respondents were included in the study, and the
   mean score in knowledge related to application of pulse oximetry was
   73.00%, while the mean score in knowledge related to factors affecting
   pulse oximetry readings was only 38.51%. A total of 90.5% of the
   respondents recognised normal pulse rate and 88.5% knew the blood oxygen
   saturation levels of a healthy adult, while 69.4% recognised the
   definition of silent hypoxia. In addition, the majority of the
   respondents agreed that factors such as poor blood circulation (71.2%),
   excessive movements (69.8%), and hand position (60.7%) affected oximetry
   readings. However, 61.7%, 81.7%, 77.2% and 76.8% of the respondents
   could not identify nail polish, skin colour, skin thickness and tattoos
   as factors that may affect oximetry readings respectively.
   Conclusions: The respondents showed a satisfactory level of knowledge
   related to application of pulse oximetry, but a poor level of knowledge
   related to factors affecting pulse oximetry readings among the community
   in Malaysia. Continuous efforts in educating the community on the
   correct use of pulse oximeters are crucial for appropriate home
   assessment and avoiding unnecessary stress.

AB As the number of COVID-19-related infections and deaths increased
   exponentially in the during 2020, few countries were equipped to manage
   and curb this novel coronavirus. Initially there was no proven cure or
   vaccine to this novel virus (SARS-Cov-2), leaving the authorities with
   no choice but to impose quarantines at the short-term expense of their
   economies. As we gain more knowledge on this novel virus, the
   tried-and-tested method of selective testing of the symptomatic
   patients, used successfully in almost all infectious respiratory
   diseases. has been replaced with trace-and-test method, as most of the
   infected patients remained asymptomatic. In early 2021. the availability
   of vaccines provided a shed of light out from this pandemic.
   Nevertheless. we faced an enormous task in juggling between vaccination
   of the population. managing patients with COVID-19 infection as well as
   non-COVID-19 patients. Here, we share our experience and response in
   managing this healthcare crisis across a two-year period during the
   pandemic and we hope other centres can learn from what we went through
   and help them derive a protocol to navigate through a future pandemic.

AB In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was officially declared a global
   pandemic by the World Health Organization. Given the novelty of the
   virus, and hence, lack of official guidance on effective containment
   strategies, individual countries opted for different containment
   approaches ranging from herd immunity to strict lockdown. The opposing
   strategies followed by the United Kingdom and its former colony,
   Malaysia, stand exemplary for this. Real-time polymerase chain reaction
   was implemented for testing in both counties. Malaysia acted with strict
   quarantining rules and infection surveillance. The United Kingdom
   followed an initially lenient, herd-immunity approach with strict
   lockdown only enforced weeks later. Although based on the same
   health-care structure historically, Malaysia developed a more unified
   health system compared with the United Kingdom. We suggest that this
   more centralized structure could be one possible explanation for why
   Malaysia was able to react in a more timely and efficient manner,
   despite its closer geographic proximity to China. We further explore how
   the differences in testing and quarantining strategy, as well as
   political situation and societal compliance could account for the
   discrepancy in the United Kingdom's versus Malaysia's relative success
   of COVID-19 containment.

AB Background: Due to the global surge in COVID-19 cases, numerous
   countries have enforced lockdowns of varying stringency. Social
   isolation and stay-at-home orders have detrimental effects on one's
   lifestyle and dietary habits. This study aimed to assess the dietary
   patterns, food preferences, shopping behavior and weight gain during the
   lockdown among students in a private university in Malaysia.
   Design and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 426
   students using convenience sampling method one-month after initiating
   the Conditional Movement Control Order (November 15-30, 2020), using a
   validated self-administered web-based survey. Chi-square test with
   post-hoc and planned comparison procedures were performed.
   Results: Of the 426 participants, more than half were females (55.9%).
   Over half of the surveyed students reported increased eating (51.2%),
   snacking (55.2%) and online food ordering (71.1%) during the lockdown.
   Meat products and sweet drinks (both >90%) were the most consumed food
   among individuals with higher BMI. 45.5% of the participants reported
   weight gain (mean 3.36, SD 1.61kg) one month after the lockdown. Female,
   youth (aged 19-24), working remotely, increased eating, snacking,
   cooking, and online food ordering were positively associated with weight
   gain.
   Conclusions: Findings suggested that unintended consequences of lockdown
   have negative impacts on dietary habits and food preferences among
   university students. Advocacy and public health measures for nutritional
   support amidst the pandemic are crucial, especially for at-risk groups
   such as overweight and obese individuals.

AB This review paper discusses some of the challenges on the effects of
   COVID-19 on aquaculture and fisheries and their mitigations and
   strategies in ASEAN perspectives with special emphasis on Malaysia due
   to significant impacts of COVID-19 occurred in this country's enormous
   aqua culture and fishing industries. Substantial factors within fishery
   systems, as well as ecological and social impacts outside their control,
   such as climate change, chronic pollution, resource degradation,
   fluctuating commodity prices and changes in management strategies that
   can asymmetrically affect different communities, stress fish culturists
   and fisher-folk communities. COVID-19's broken food supply chain and
   shrinking market have certainly impacted everyone in the fishing and
   aquaculture business, with small-scale fishermen being the most
   susceptible. During COVID19 pandemic in ASEAN countries, it was
   discovered that the potential effects on agricultural sectors in
   Malaysia needed to be protected in order to defend the well-being of
   farmers, breeders, fishers, and workers, the majority of whom are
   low-income earners. The relevant authorities have created different
   supply chains and expand supply sources to maintain revenue in the event
   of a national economic downturn through traditional marketing channels.
   The Post COVID-19 monitoring should be undertaken as a model role based
   on the Malaysian scenario to gain a quick grasp of the food security and
   livelihood situation of all fishing communities. As a result, a national
   platform is urgently needed to boost production, supply, and marketing
   integration so that the fisheries and aquaculture products may be traded
   efficiently. Nevertheless, transparency in policy responses, as well as
   regional and international cooperation, will support to build trust in
   the future of fish value chains and markets. Furthermore, these
   real-world lessons will make it easier to learn from the pandemic crisis
   to improve the sustainability and viability of fisheries and aquaculture
   industries in ASEAN countries and global as well.

AB Insufficient information on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has made it
   more difficult for the world to tackle its continuous implosion.
   Meteorological and environmental factors, in both laboratory and
   epidemiological studies, have been reported to affect the survival and
   transmission of the virus. In this study, the possible effects of
   location-specific meteorological parameters in a tropical climate on new
   daily COVID-19 infection (NDI) are investigated in Kuala Lumpur from 14
   March 2020 to 31 August 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was
   imposed on ambient temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH) to explore
   their nonlinear relationship with NDI. Piecewise linear regression was
   then used to further discern the relationships below and above the
   threshold values of both T and AH. The relationship between T and NDI,
   which was linear and statistically significant for T > 29.7 degrees C,
   showed that each unit rise in temperature increases NDI by about 3.210%
   (CI: 1.372-7.976). AH had a more pronounced linear association with NDI
   for AH <= 22.6 g/m(3) but tended to flatten the exposure-response curve
   above this value. A 1 g/m(3) increase in AH increases NDI by 3.807% (CI:
   2.064-5.732). Generally, the results indicated a positive association
   between T and NDI, particularly above 29.7 degrees C, while the
   association with AH showed a stronger positive relationship below 22.6
   g/m(3). The implication of this is that COVID-19 could not be suppressed
   on account of warmer weather as such public health interventions remain
   imperative.

   psychological capital (self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and resilience)
   affects organizational resilience. By structural equation modeling (AMOS
   21.0), 644 small tourism firm owners in Malaysia were randomly selected
   to investigate the relationship between psychological capital and
   organizational resilience, and the mediating effect of problem-focused
   and emotion-focused coping strategies on this relationship. The findings
   of the study supported hypothesized relationships, as the psychological
   capital of small tourism firm owners in Malaysia significantly affects
   organizational resilience. Furthermore, the study discovered that
   problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies have partial
   mediating effects on the association between psychological capital and

AB This study aims to explore the state-wise assessment of SARS-CoV-2
   (COVID-19) pandemic spread in Malaysia with focus on influence of
   meteorological parameters and air quality. In this study, state-wise
   COVID-19 data, meteorological parameters and air quality index (AQI)
   were collected from March 13 to April 30, 2020, which encompass three
   movement control order (MCO) periods in the country. Overall, total
   infected cases were observed to be higher in MCO phase 1 and 2 and
   significantly reduced in MCO phase 3. Due to the variation in the
   spatial interval of population density and individual immunity, the
   relationship of these parameters to pandemic spread could not be
   achieved. The study infers that temperature (T) between 23 and 25
   degrees C and relative humidity (RH) (70-80%) triggered the pandemic
   spread by increase in the infected cases in northern and central
   Peninsular Malaysia. Selangor, WP Kuala Lumpur and WP Putrajaya show
   significantly high infected cases and a definite trend was not observed
   with respect to a particular meteorological factor. It is identified
   that high precipitation (PPT), RH and good air quality have reduced the
   spread in East Malaysia. A negative correlation of T and AQI and
   positive correlation of RH with total infected cases were found during
   MCO phase 3. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that T, RH,
   PPT, dew point (DP) and AQI are the main controlling factors for the
   spread across the country apart from social distancing. Vulnerability
   zones were identified based on the spatial analysis of T, RH, PPT and
   AQI with reference to total infected cases. Based on time series
   analysis, it was determined that higher RH and T in Peninsular Malaysia
   and high amount of PPT, RH and good air quality in East Malaysia have
   controlled the spreading during MCO phase 3. The predominance of D614
   mutant was observed prior to March and decreases at the end of March,
   coinciding with the fluctuation of meteorological factors and air
   quality. The outcome of this study gives a general awareness to the
   public on COVID-19 and the influence of meteorological factors. It will
   also help the policymakers to enhance the management plans against the
   pandemic spreading apart from social distancing in the next wave of

   explored the structure prediction and functional analysis of 75 Malaysia
   SARS-CoV-2 strain's structural and accessory proteins without the
   presence of experimental models. Physiochemical analysis, secondary
   structure analysis, structure prediction, functional characterization,
   active site identification, and evolutionary analysis based on the amino
   acid sequences retrieved from National Centre for Biotechnology
   Information (NCBI). Three-dimensional (3-D) protein structures were
   built using the Swiss model. The quality of protein models was verified
   by ERRAT, PROCHECK, and Verify 3D tools. Active prediction analysis
   revealed the high potential active sites of proteins where the
   anti-viral drug or vaccine may bind and inhibit the viral activities.
   Molecular phylogenetic analysis of ORF10, ORF8, and ORF6 proteins from
   five different species was analyzed. The results from this analysis
   proved that Homo sapiens SARS-CoV-2 had high genetic similarity with the
   bat coronavirus. These analyses may help in designing structure-based
   antiviral drugs or to develop potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.

AB Malaysia had 10,219 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of September 20,
   2020. About 33% were associated with a Tablighi Jamaat religious mass
   gathering held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 3, 2020,
   which drove community transmission during Malaysia's main wave. We
   analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to better
   understand the molecular epidemiology and spread. We obtained 58
   SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences from patients in Kuala Lumpur and
   performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 57 Malaysian
   sequences available in the GISAID database. Nine different SARS-CoV-2
   lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were
   detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after
   the Tablighi mass gathering and became predominant (65.2%) despite being
   relatively rare (1.4%) globally. Direct epidemiological links between
   lineage B.6 viruses and the mass gathering were identified. Increases in
   reported total cases, Tablighi-associated cases, and community-acquired
   B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly
   travel-associated and showed limited onward transmission. There were
   also temporally correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast
   Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning
   from this event. Over 95% of global B.6 sequences originated from Asia
   Pacific. We also report a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 47.3% of
   global B.6 sequences which was associated with reduced sensitivity using
   a commercial diagnostic real-time PCR assay. Lineage B.6 became the
   predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely
   introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also
   contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the
   Asia-Pacific. Mass gatherings can be significant causes of local and
   global spread of COVID-19. Shared genomic surveillance can be used to
   identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains to aid prevention and control,
   and to monitor diagnostic molecular assays.
   Author summary
   The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia was driven mainly by transmission
   following a religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of
   February 2020. To study the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in
   Malaysia, we analysed 57 available and 58 newly generated Malaysian
   whole genome virus sequences. We found that lineage B.6, rare (1.4%)
   globally, first appeared after the mass gathering, was linked to
   attendees, and became predominant (65.2%) in Malaysia. Increases in
   COVID-19 cases and locally acquired B.6 strains were temporally linked.
   Non-B.6 viruses were mainly associated with travel and showed limited
   spread. Increases in B.6 viruses in Asia Pacific countries were
   temporally linked to participants returning from this mass gathering.
   Altogether, 95% of global B.6 sequences originated in Asia Pacific
   countries. We also report a mutation in the virus nsp3 gene found in
   47.3% of global B.6 sequences and associated with reduced detection by a
   commercial diagnostic test. In conclusion, the religious mass gathering
   in Kuala Lumpur was associated with the main wave of COVID-19 cases of
   predominantly B.6 lineage in Malaysia, and subsequent spread of B.6
   viruses regionally. Genome sequence data provides valuable insight into
   virus spread and is important for monitoring continued accuracy of
   diagnostic kits.

   healthcare workers (HCWs) who are frontliners directly involved in
   mitigating the spread of the disease. This paper focuses on the
   utilization of a clinical practice protocol for identifying HCWs who are
   COVID-19-positive or under investigation and surveillance for suspected
   infection, in a tertiary, university teaching hospital of Malaysia. The
   protocol for Psychological First Aid (PFA), which is applied remotely
   via a mobile application and phone calls, outlines the work process in
   stages, with expected immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals
   within a "Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Realistic
   Timeframe" (SMART). This protocol is developed to provide a guideline
   for psychological crisis interventions that promote safety, calm, and
   hope in HCWs, allowing them to return to psychological functioning
   without being stigmatized. The unprecedented remote PFA protocol may
   serve as a platform for further research on the application of a
   goal-directed approach in a healthcare organization.

AB Background The pandemic of SARS CoV2 virus has severely impacted the
   entire world population. The lockdown imposed during the pandemic has
   created enormous challenges particularly on the health, economic and
   social life of most individuals. This study aimed to investigate the
   changes in health-related lifestyle and food security during the
   lockdown and how they influenced the quality of life (QoL) of Malaysian
   adults. Methods An online survey using a structured questionnaire
   consisting of sociodemographic, body weight, diet quality, physical
   activity, sleep quality, food insecurity, and QoL was conducted among
   adult respondents across Malaysia. Multivariate linear regression
   analyses were conducted to assess the associations between the changes
   in each component and QoL based on the total score before and during the
   lockdown. Results A total of 759 valid responses were included in the
   final analysis (75% female and 24.5% male). There was a significant
   improvement in diet quality during the lockdown while sleep quality and
   food insecurity worsened significantly. As for physical activity,
   metabolic equivalents (METs) in moderate activity increased
   significantly, whilst there was a significant decrease in the METs in
   walking and total minutes spent on physical activity during the
   lockdown. Overall, independent of age, gender, ethnicity, and religion,
   there were significant associations between QoL during lockdown and
   changes in BMI, METs of moderate activity, sleep quality, and food
   insecurity. Conclusions The unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak and the
   lockdown measure during the pandemic have caused significant negative
   changes in health-related lifestyles and affected the QoL of Malaysian
   adults. Despite the new norms and rules to prevent disease transmission,
   efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle and food security among the
   population must be rolled out to improve the QoL and prevent further
   adverse mental and physical health outcomes.

AB Malaysia and Indonesia have taken a soft border approach to govern their
   Tebedu-Entikong border regions. Both governments have open but
   controlled customs, immigration, and quarantine facilities to manage
   cross-border movement of people, goods, and capital. Unfortunately, the
   ongoing cross-border governance was challenged by a non-traditional
   security threat, i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020.
   The pandemic has the potential to impede the implementation of bilateral
   border policies which could jeopardize the efforts of the Socio-economy
   of Malaysia-Indonesia Committee (Sosek Malindo) to effectively integrate
   both economies in the border region since its inception in 1985. In
   relation to this context, this paper aims to: (i) evaluate the
   challenges/impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and outstanding border issues
   on trade and development in the Entikong-Tebedu border region; and (ii)
   assess the role of Sosek Malindo in promoting greater integration and
   seamless connectivity in the Entikong-Tebedu border region. This paper
   presents a case-study on the Entikong-Tebedu border region and draws its
   observations and findings from inferences and interpretation of data
   collected from officials and other credible sources. Desk research was
   conducted on reports of Sosek Malindo meetings and research materials.
   Fieldwork was also conducted to observe the socioeconomic development
   status at the location of interest. The evaluation and assessment can be
   a reference point to reformulate cross-border governance policies that
   are characteristically a win-win solution for both parties by
   guaranteeing national security without compromising the socioeconomic
   development of the border region.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has altered consumers? relationship with food,
   whether through shopping, increased home cooking, taking pre-cautionary
   measures during food shopping, food delivery and whilst dining out. This
   study aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on consumers? food
   safety knowledge, attitude and practices and to identify the predictors
   of food safety practices during COVID-19. An online survey was conducted
   and received valid responses from 987 respondents. Data were analysed
   using descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests, Spearman?s rho
   correlation and multiple regression. The Theory of Planned Behaviour
   (TPB) model was used to investigate the intention to practice safe
   eating out measures during COVID-19. The mean food safety knowledge
   score was 6.37 ? 1.37 (9.00 = highest score) of which 91.3% of total
   respondents from Indonesia and Malaysia scored ?5 points. Consumers also
   demonstrated positive food safety attitude (4.06 ? 0.99) and reported
   high frequencies in conducting food safety practices (4.03 ? 0.82)
   during COVID-19. The TPB has provided valuable framework for
   understanding consumers? intention to practice safe eating out measures
   during COVID-19. The multiple regression model explained 63% and 73% of
   the variance in adherence to safe eating out practices in Indonesia and
   Malaysia and (p < 0.05) respectively. All the TPB antecedents i.e.
   attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control were
   identified as significant predictors on consumers? eating out practices.
   This suggests that consumers with positive food safety attitude and
   strong family norms were more likely to adhere to safe eating out
   measures (e.g. selection of clean and less crowded restaurants,
   practicing hand hygiene, wearing masks and practising social
   distancing). The findings also suggest that to fully adhere to the safe
   practices, it is important to have sufficient support from restaurant
   staff to ensure social distancing and to provide adequate handwashing
   facilities. This is the first study to provide new empirical findings on
   consumers? intention to practice safe eating out measures during
   COVID-19.

AB This study intends to deal with the environmental consequences of the
   COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, by providing a summary of the effects of
   COVID-19 on municipal solid waste (MSW). In this analysis, the data on
   domestic waste collection were collected from the Solid Waste Management
   and Public Cleaning Corporation (SWCorp) from 1 January 2020 to 31
   December 2020 to evaluate the relative changes in MSW percentage via a
   waste weighing method. The data consisted of the cumulative tonnage of
   MSW for every local authority in Peninsular Malaysia and was classified
   according to MCO phases; before the MCO, during the MCO, during the
   conditional MCO (CMCO) and during the recovery MCO (RMCO) phases. The
   results indicated that the enforcement of the early MCO showed a
   positive effect by decreasing the volume of MSW. This decrease was noted
   across 41 local authorities, which accounts for 87.23% of Peninsular
   Malaysia. However, the amount of MSW began to increase again when the
   MCO reached the conditional and recovery stages. From this, it can be
   concluded that the implementation of the MCO, in its various
   incarnations, has shown us that our lifestyles can have a harmful impact
   on our environment. While the pandemic was still spreading and
   limitations were still in place in Malaysia, local governments and waste
   management companies had to quickly alter their waste management systems
   and procedures. The current circumstance allows us to rethink our social
   and economic structures while improving environmental and social
   inclusion.

AB Purpose: We present the implementation of e-learning in the Master of

   lockdown from March to June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Teaching and Learning (T&L) activities were conducted virtually
   on e-learning platforms. The students' experience and feedback were
   evaluated after 15 weeks.
   Results: We found that while students preferred face-to-face, physical
   teaching, they were able to adapt to the new norm of e-learning. More
   than 60% of the students agreed that pre-recorded lectures and viewing
   videos of practical sessions, plus answering short questions, were
   beneficial. Certain aspects, such as hands-on practical and clinical
   experience, could never be replaced. The e-learning and study-from-home
   environment accorded a lot of flexibility. However, students also found
   it challenging to focus because of distractions, lack of engagement and
   mental stress. Technical problems, such as poor Internet connectivity
   and limited data plans, also compounded the problem.
   Conclusion: We expect e-learning to prevail in future. Hybrid learning
   strategies, which includes face-to-face classes and e-learning, will
   become common, at least in the medical physics programme of the
   University of Malaya even after the pandemic.

AB Background The COVID-19 pandemic prompted movement restrictions in
   countries worldwide, impacting on physical activity (PA), a major
   non-communicable disease risk factor, and thus may have unintentional
   long-term health implications. In semi-rural areas of
   low-middle-income-countries (LMICs), where occupational activity is the
   main source of PA, changes in PA associated with COVID-19 restrictions
   are unknown. We investigated the impact of Movement Control Order (MCO)
   restrictions in a semi-rural region of Malaysia. Methods The South East
   Asia Community Observatory (SEACO) is a dynamic prospective community
   cohort. We contacted a random sample of 1007 adults (18+) who had
   previously provided PA data in 2018. We asked about PA during the MCO
   (March-May 2020) and at the time of interview (June 2020). Results
   During the MCO, PA reduced by a mean of 6.7 hours/week (95% confidence
   interval (CI) = 5.3, 8.0) compared to 2018, with the largest reductions
   among those in employment. By June, PA was 3.4 hours/week (95% CI = 2.0,
   4.8) less than 2018, leaving 34% of adults currently inactive (20% in
   2018). Reductions in occupational PA were not replaced with active
   travel or activity at home. Despite these observed reductions, most
   participants did not think the MCO had affected their PA. Conclusions
   Movement restrictions are associated with lower PA lasting beyond the
   period of strict restrictions; such longer-term reductions in PA may
   have a detrimental impact on health. Future MCOs should encourage people
   to be active, but may additionally need targeted messaging for those who
   don't necessarily realise they are at risk. In particular, policies
   developed in more affluent countries may not easily translate to LMICs.

AB The newly discovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an
   infectious disease introduced to humans for the first time. Following
   the pandemic of COVID-19, there is a major shift of practices among
   surgical departments in response to an unprecedented surge in reducing
   the transmission of disease. With pooling and outsourcing of more health
   care workers to emergency rooms, public health care services and medical
   services, further in-hospital resources are prioritised to those in
   need. It is imperative to balance the requirements of caring for
   COVID-19 patients with imminent risk of delay to others who need care.
   As Malaysia now approaches the recovery phase following the pandemic,
   the crisis impacted significantly on neurosurgical services throughout
   the country. Various emergency measures taken at the height of the
   crisis may remain as the new normal in the provision of neurosurgical
   services and practices in Malaysia. The crisis has certainly put a
   strain on the effective delivery of services and as we approach the
   recovery era, what may have been a strain may prove to be a silver
   lining in neurosurgical services in Malaysia. The following details are
   various measures put in place as the new operational protocols for
   neurosurgical services in Malaysia.

AB Purpose
   In the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, organizations now are expected to
   serve customers who are highly conscious of safety and sanitation. Among
   others, the hospitality industry is significantly and negatively
   influenced by this pandemic. Given the unique characteristics of
   services, using advanced technology is not enough to create a memorable
   experience without physical interaction between service providers and
   customers. Thus, this study aims to define the "new normal" for service
   customers and to explore the "new service design" for the hotel
   industry.
   Design/methodology/approach
   As most of the Southeast Asian countries heavily rely on the tourism
   industry, this study focuses on one of the emerging tourism destinations
   in this region, Malaysia. The data is collected through in-depth
   interviews with 17 potential national and international tourists.
   Findings
   The results suggest that considering the "new normal" for customers,
   there is an immediate need for the hotel industry to revamp their
   service design by mainly practicing disinfection and sanitation
   activities, re-designing overall infrastructure and introducing
   promotional offers.
   Originality/value
   This study is novel in its kind as it provides useful guidelines for
   both practitioners and academicians/researchers. Under this crucial
   time, very few research is conducted specifically focusing on the hotel
   industry and tourists' behaviors amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The study
   will provide in-depth knowledge about tourists' expectations from the
   hotel services, especially in their own voices.

AB The general process of learning in educational institutions around the
   globe has changed since the advent of the COVID-19 virus. Educational
   sectors in all nations are forced to adapt and rearrange their
   compositions and systems as the virus spreads. The current study
   considers the characteristics and issues related to universities moving
   towards online and blended learning during this period of universal
   isolation. Through focus group interviews conducted in South Korea and
   Malaysia, the study provides recommendation for the improvement of
   online classes and blended learning. The use of student focus groups
   gives the research an alternative perspective with which to assess the
   satisfaction level, success, and quality of online learning programs
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from the focus groups show that
   for the success of online learning to become a reality, blended
   education should be considered to bolster learning. Further, results
   show that communication between lecturers and students remains a
   fundamental factor for success, regardless of the class category
   incorporated. Consequently, the results of the study provide further
   insight into matters experienced by students during the pandemic, and
   how educators may heed the opinions of students when improving future
   related blended learning programs.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is one of the most
   widely used questionnaires to measure psychosocial adjustment in
   children. SDQ has been translated into more than 60 languages. However,
   a published review of 48 studies from 17 different cultural settings
   reported that the mean and cut-off scores of the SDQ have shown some
   variation across cultural settings. The discrepancies found in the
   existing literatures for the factor structure require further
   investigation. Thus, the aim of the current study is to evaluate the
   psychometric properties of parent rating SDQ in the Malaysian context,
   especially during the pandemic. A total of 315 Malaysian parents of
   children in the age range of 9 to 11 years old who responded to the
   online survey participated in this study. The results demonstrated
   acceptable reliability with the internal consistency of Cronbach's Alpha
   ranging from .69 to .79 for the subscales of the SDQ except for the
   subscale of peer problems (Cronbach's Alpha = .53) indicated
   insufficient reliability indexed. The model of SDQ showed a fair fit to
   the data. The results suggested that peer problem items did not reflect
   the implication during the pandemic. There is a need to further explore
   the psychological adjustment after the outbreak of COVID-19.

AB For the first time in the 21(st) century, many nations have been forced
   to conduct a lockdown that restricts their industrial, transportation,
   and social activities to avoid the extensive COVID-19 spread. Therefore,
   our study aimed to analyze the status of water quality that was measured
   by suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Sungai Langat, Selangor,
   Malaysia using the remote sensing technique. The study was concerned
   with rivers located in distinct land-use areas such as high-density
   urban, low-density urban, and agricultural areas. The study period
   included before and after movement control order (MCO) periods that
   occurred in February 2020 and February 2021, respectively. The SPM
   levels in each period were calculated using the remote sensing technique
   through Landsat-8 OLI images then they were analyzed using statistical
   analysis. The results of the remote sensing technique showed the highest
   decrease of SPM levels during the MCO period was observed in Sungai
   Langat within a high-density urban area (34.1%). Then, the SPM levels in
   all Sungai Langat raised significantly after the MCO period with the
   highest change at 31.6%. Rainfall and erosion factors had a significant
   impact on the SPM level through natural processes but the COVID-19
   restriction had a direct impact on the SPM level due to the restriction
   of industrial and social activities. The suspended activities have made
   the lower emission compared with before the COVID-19 period in 2019.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis that has caused a punishing
   economic impact on businesses, particularly due to many countries
   adopting measures such as the Movement Control Order (MCO) to curb the
   spread of the COVID-19 disease. The impact hits the most on
   microentrepreneurs since they are not able to operate their businesses,
   of which the margins of profit and resources are relatively small. The
   purpose of this research was to explore the challenges faced by
   microentrepreneurs during MCO and their coping strategies used to
   overcome these challenges. This study utilized the qualitative case
   study approach and collected interview data among the identified
   microentrepreneurs that met the criterion sampling. The findings uncover
   that these microentrepreneurs typically faced challenges related to
   restricted cash flows, lack of customers and supplies shortage issues
   which impacted their income and business operations during MCO. These
   challenges were addressed using coping strategies, namely having the
   ability to control stress, developing a strong spiritual relationship
   with God, applying problem solving thinking skills, utilizing social
   capital (offline and online), and optimizing digital marketing. It is
   recommended that government agencies, NGOs, and social movement bodies
   contribute to microentrepreneurs by organising and engaging in digital
   empowerment programs to enable rural entrepreneurs to leverage on their
   access to digital commerce, internet marketing and alike.

   On 18th March 2020, the Malaysian government put into action an enforced
   movement control order (MCO) to reduce the numbers of infections. This
   study aims to investigate the con-centrations of air pollutants during
   the MCO in the Klang Valley. The concentrations of air pollutants were
   recorded by the continuous air quality monitoring system (CAQMS)
   operated by the Department of Environment. The results showed that there
   were significant reductions (p < 0.05) of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and CO during
   the MCO compared with the same periods in 2019 and 2018. The highest
   percentage of reduction during the MCO was recorded by NO2 with a
   percentage reduction of between -55 % and -72 %. O-3 concentrations at
   several stations showed an increase due to the reductions of its
   precursors such as NO. Further investigation using diurnal patterns of
   air pollutant concentrations both before and during the MCO showed that
   NO2 and CO were both reduced significantly during the rush hours,
   indicating the reduction in motor vehicles on the roads as a consequence
   of the MCO influenced the levels of these pollutants.

   in managing Work-Life Balance (WLB) during the COVID-19 pandemic in
   Malaysia. Data was obtained through online and offline surveys which
   were distributed to the agencies in the public and private sectors
   spread across Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Pura Jaya. Overall 466
   respondents were found to have given valid and complete responses. This
   research utilized the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation
   Modelling. It was found that the use of the ICT during Work from Home
   (WFH) helped workers to have relatively high flexibility where they
   could easily expand or contract one domain to meet the demands of
   another domain. At the same time it also offered high permeability where
   aspects of one domain entered another domain. This encourages workers to
   integrate their roles and achieve broad work autonomy. Furthermore, this
   situation then gives rise to a high level of interference at the
   boundary between work and family domains. On the other hand Ugahari
   reduces the level of interference caused by ICT use and encourages
   workers to compartmentalize their respective roles. Thus, ICT and
   Ugahari's behavior can play a role and complement each other in the
   context of realizing worker well-being.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led Malaysia to introduce movement
   control orders (MCOs). While MCOs were intended to slow the spread of
   COVID-19, the effects of such measures on the noncommunicable disease
   (NCD) risk factors have not been fully explored. This exploratory study
   aimed to understand the effect of the MCO on the eating habits and
   physical activity levels of the urban poor in Malaysia as well as
   potential health promotion interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: This rapid assessment used a mixed-method approach in three
   low-cost public flats in Kuala Lumpur targeting the B40, which is the
   bottom 40% of the economic spectrum. A total of 95 community members
   participated in a quantitative phone survey, while 21 respondents
   participated in a qualitative phone survey, including 12 community
   members and nine community health volunteers (CHVs). Results: The
   movement restriction imposed during the MCO significantly reduced the
   frequency and duration of respondents' physical activity. At the same
   time, respondents reported significantly increased consumption of
   home-cooked meals. More than half of respondents reduced their
   consumption of packaged snack foods (53.7%), street desserts (54.7%),
   fast food (50.5%), soft drinks (50.5%), and 3-in-1 or instant drinks
   (50.5%) due to limited access during the MCO. B40 communities were
   receptive to potential interventions to encourage healthier eating and
   physical activity leveraging digital approaches under the 'new normal'.
   Reported concerns included internet accessibility and affordability,
   functionality, and digital literacy. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic
   requires innovation to address diseases and risk factors at the
   community level. While movement restrictions reduced physical activity,
   they created opportunities for low-income individuals to have greater
   control over their diet, enabling them to adopt healthier eating habits.
   Lifestyle changes experienced by vulnerable populations provide an
   opportunity for creative and technology-enabled interventions to promote
   healthy eating and exercise.

   China. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge,
   attitude and practice regarding COVID-19 and its transmission, causes
   and prevention among people living in Malaysia. Methods A
   cross-sectional study was conducted among people living in Malaysia by
   using an online survey in March and April 2020. Results Out of 520
   respondents, the mean age was 36.9 +/- 14.9, between 19 and 67 years
   with the majority being female. Most respondents had good knowledge,
   attitude and practice towards COVID-19 with mean +/- sd 18.2 +/- 1.7,
   5.2 +/- 1.1 and 4.1 +/- 1.4, respectively. In addition, the majority had
   good knowledge regarding cause, mode of transmission, signs and
   symptoms, prevention and treatment and quarantine measures after
   answering 21 questions. Conclusion To date, there is no specific
   treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, thus staying at home is the best
   preventive measure to curb the further growth of positive cases in the
   country. These findings could provide an insight in designing effective
   preparedness for future pandemic outbreaks.

AB Background Healthcare providers are vulnerable in the fight against
   COVID-19 and may experience significant psychological and mental health
   consequences. This study aimed to compare the levels of depressive
   symptoms among frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in
   response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in two
   government hospitals managing COVID-19-related cases in Kelantan,
   Malaysia from May to July 2020 to identify and compared depressive
   symptoms levels of frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers.
   Convenient sampling was applied in the selection of eligible
   participants and those diagnosed as having any psychiatric illnesses
   were excluded. The self-administered questionnaires for the Malay
   versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure
   depressive symptoms score and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support
   Survey to measure social support score as an important confounder. A
   descriptive analysis, independent t-test and ANCOVA were performed using
   SPSS version 26.
   Results A total of 306 respondents from healthcare providers were
   recruited which 160 were frontline healthcare providers and 146 were
   non-frontline healthcare providers. The level of depressive symptoms
   (HADS score >8) was 27.5% for the frontline healthcare providers and
   37.7% for the non-frontline healthcare providers. The mean depressive
   symptoms score for the non-frontline healthcare providers was 0.75
   points higher than that of the frontline healthcare providers after
   adjusting for gender, duration of employment and social support.
   Conclusion Non-frontline healthcare providers are also experiencing
   psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic even though they do
   not have direct contact with COVID-19 patients.

AB The outbreak of a neurological disorder was first discovered as a new
   coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China. The infection spread rapidly in
   China and throughout the world, including Malaysia. Malaysia recorded
   its initial case on 25 January 2020 with intensifying numbers since
   March 2020. Due to this uncertain circumstance, Malaysia has introduced
   the Movement Control Order (MCO) with the main aim of isolating the
   source of the COVID-19 outbreak, which was effective from 18 March 2020.
   The restriction has observed fewer vehicles on the road with industrial
   and commercial activities being suspended. The objective of the study is
   to quantify the effects of MCO to food waste generation in town and
   district areas of Klang Valley, Malaysia. Food waste generation data was
   derived from the Project Delivery Department, KDEB Waste Management on a
   daily basis before (19 February-17 March 2020) and during the MCO (18
   March-14 April 2020) at 12 local authorities in Selangor, Malaysia. The
   data was obtained with the limitation of assumption that there is no
   waste compositional analysis to be conducted in 2020. Despite the
   stay-at-home order, food waste data showed a descriptive reduction of up
   to 15.1% during the MCO. Statistical analysis of food waste generation
   from one-way variance has shown that municipal and district local
   authorities recorded a significant reduction (p < 0.50) during the MCO.
   The food waste reduction during the MCO will deliver as the
   evidence-based results to push the need for policies in Malaysia as per
   the goals outlined in Sustainable Development Goals of global food loss
   and waste.

AB Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isolation has
   altered individuals' food purchasing behaviour and dietary intake
   patterns. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the changes in
   dietary intake patterns and their impacts on the weight status of young
   adults in Malaysia during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: This
   cross-sectional study involved 1045 young adults in Malaysia. The
   changes in dietary intake patterns were assessed using the Dietary
   Diversity Questionnaire with slight modifications, while anthropometric
   measurements including body height, body weight before the pandemic and
   current body weight were self-reported. Results: Overall, nearly half of
   the respondents (48.8%) gained weight during the confinement, with an
   average increment of 4.06 +/- 3.23 kg. Of 1045, 45.3% reported consuming
   more fruits and 60.2% had higher plain water intake during the pandemic.
   It is observed that 41.0% to 66.8% of the young adults changed their
   dietary intake patterns during the pandemic. Increased consumption in
   cereals and grains (beta = 0.084, p = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.017-0.160), as
   well as oils and fats (beta = 0.123, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.059-0.241),
   was positively associated with weight gain during the pandemic. On the
   contrary, an increased plain water intake was negatively associated with
   weight gain during the lockdown (beta = -0.100, p = 0.003, 95% CI =
   -0.171--0.034). Findings in the current study also suggested that
   cutting back cereals and grains (beta = 0.156, p < 0.001, 95% CI =
   0.122-0.288), as well as oils and fats (beta = 0.091, p = 0.012, 95% CI
   = 0.022-0.183), contributed significantly to weight loss during the
   pandemic confinement. Conclusion: In conclusion, the enforcement of the
   Movement Control Order (MCO) drove up the prevalence of
   overweight/obesity among young adults in Malaysia. Increased consumption
   of cereals and grains and oils and fats contributed to weight gain in
   the pandemic lockdown. Nonetheless, a noticeable proportion of young
   adults in Malaysia shifted to a healthier food choice by increasing the
   consumption of fruits and vegetables.

TI When do persuasive messages on vaccine safety steer COVID-19 vaccine
   acceptance and recommendations? Behavioural insights from a randomised

AB Introduction Vaccine safety is a primary concern among vaccine-hesitant
   individuals. We examined how seven persuasive messages with different
   frames, all focusing on vaccine safety, influenced Malaysians to accept
   the COVID-19 vaccine, and recommend it to individuals with different
   health and age profiles; that is, healthy adults, the elderly, and
   people with pre-existing health conditions.
   Methods A randomised controlled experiment was conducted from 29 April
   to 7 June 2021, which coincided with the early phases of the national
   vaccination programme when vaccine uptake data were largely unavailable.
   5784 Malaysians were randomly allocated into 14 experimental arms and
   exposed to one or two messages that promoted COVID-19 vaccination.
   Interventional messages were applied alone or in combination and
   compared against a control message. Outcome measures were assessed as
   intent to both take the vaccine and recommend it to healthy adults, the
   elderly, and people with pre-existing health conditions, before and
   after message exposure. Changes in intent were modelled and we estimated
   the average marginal effects based on changes in the predicted
   probability of responding with a positive intent for each of the four
   outcomes.
   Results We found that persuasive communication via several of the
   experimented messages improved recommendation intentions to people with
   pre-existing health conditions, with improvements ranging from 4 to 8
   percentage points. In contrast, none of the messages neither
   significantly improved vaccination intentions, nor recommendations to
   healthy adults and the elderly. Instead, we found evidence suggestive of
   backfiring among certain outcomes with messages using negative attribute
   frames, risky choice frames, and priming descriptive norms.
   Conclusion Message frames that briefly communicate verbatim facts and
   stimulate rational thinking regarding vaccine safety may be ineffective
   at positively influencing vaccine-hesitant individuals. Messages
   intended to promote recommendations of novel health interventions to
   people with pre-existing health conditions should incorporate safety
   dimensions.

AB Purpose: A different pattern of mental health issues was reported during
   the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, few studies have
   examined Malaysians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) prevalent
   during this time. Patients and Methods: A nationwide online
   cross-sectional study was conducted in Malaysia from June 1, 2021 to
   June 14, 2021, ie, 18-months from the first reported COVID-19 case in
   the country. Citizens aged 18 years and above were recruited by means of
   the snowball sampling method. ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and linear
   regression tests were used. Results: Of the 2168 respondents, most were
   young adults (62.7%), females (62.4%), tertiary educated individuals
   (84%), non-health care workers (85.9%), and individuals who knew someone
   diagnosed with COVID-19 (75.2%). The mean score for knowledge was 10.0
   +/- 1.52 (maximum score = 12); correct response rate for each question
   ranged from 54.2% to 99%. The mean score in terms of attitude was 1.3
   +/- 0.85 (maximum score = 2); 68.7% respondents agreed that control over
   COVID-19 would finally be achieved; and 62.3% believed that Malaysia
   could conquer COVID-19. The mean score for practices was 5.1 +/- 1.10
   (maximum score = 6); 81.5%, 88.1%, and 74.1% respondents avoided crowded
   places, confined spaces, and conversations in close physical proximity,
   respectively. Furthermore, 94.2% wore masks when leaving home; 89.0%
   practiced hand hygiene; and 83.8% adhering to COVID-19 warnings. Small
   but significant correlations were found between knowledge and attitude
   (r = 0.078, p < 0.001) as well as between knowledge and practices (r =
   0.070, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Malaysians exhibited sound knowledge but
   negative attitudes and inadequate practices pertaining to COVID-19
   during the pandemic's later stage. At this phase, unlike at the early
   stage, the public's sound knowledge ensured little improvement in their
   attitudes and practices. Therefore, health education at the later
   pandemic stage should focus on promoting positive attitudes and
   developing better practices.

AB Background Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most prevalent mental
   health disorder after childbirth, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   In addition, PPD is known to have a long-term influence on the mother
   and the newborn, and the role of social support network is crucial in
   early illness recognition. This study aims to evaluate the social
   support networks' level of knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding
   PPD and examine their sociodemographic variables and exposure to the
   public information relating to PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic in
   Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online
   Google Form disseminated to people in Klang Valley through WhatsApp,
   Email, Facebook, Instagram and other available social media among
   postpartum women's social support networks aged 18 years and living in
   the Klang Valley area (N = 394). Data were collected from 1 March to 5
   July 2021 and analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and generalised
   linear mixed models. Results During the COVID-19 epidemic in Klang
   Valley, most participants had good knowledge, negative attitudes and
   awareness of PPD. Marital status, gender and parity all had significant
   correlations with the amount of awareness regarding PPD. Ethnicity,
   gender, parity and educational level showed significant association with
   attitude towards PPD. No significant relationship was noted between
   sociodemographic variables and PPD beliefs. Public awareness of PPD was
   also associated with knowledge and attitude towards it. Conclusions A
   significant positive knowledge, negative attitude and negative awareness
   level of PPD exist among social support networks for postnatal women.
   However, no significant effect of belief on PPD awareness level was
   noted. Implications Insight campaigns and public education about PPD
   should be conducted to enhance postnatal mothers' awareness and
   knowledge. Postnatal care, mental check-ups and counselling sessions for
   the new mothers are recommended. In future studies, a closer assessment
   of postpartum social support, variances and similarities across women
   from diverse racial/ethnic origins is critical. Strengths and
   limitations This cross-sectional study is one of the early studies on
   the area of PPD in the Malaysian region during COVID-19. Numerous data
   have been collected using low-cost approaches using self-administered
   surveys through Google Forms in this research.

   medical students in UKM participated in this cross-sectional study from
   May to July 2021. A self-administered questionnaire consisting of
   questions on the participant's sociodemographic data and items from the
   DASS-21, CBI, and Brief-COPE was distributed. Chi-square and Spearman's
   correlation tests were used to calculate the correlation coefficient
   between both anxiety and burnout, and coping mechanisms. The prevalence
   of anxiety and burnout were 44.2% and 22.2%, respectively. There was a
   significant difference in the percentage of students with extremely
   severe anxiety in the presence and absence of burnout, 23.8% vs. 4.8% (p
   < 0.001). Among the three coping mechanisms, avoidant coping had a
   significant positive moderate correlation with both the presence of
   anxiety (r = 0.3966, p < 0.001) and the presence of burnout (r = 0.341,
   p < 0.001). Meanwhile, coping that was neither approach nor avoidant had
   a positive weak correlation with the presence of burnout (r = 0.176, p =
   0.001). The prevalence of anxiety and burnout was concerning. Increased
   anxiety and burnout among students may negatively impact aspects of
   their personal, professional, and academic lives. Early recognition and
   preventive measures should be emphasised to prevent negative
   ramifications.

AB Background: As the number of COVID-19 cases grows worldwide, one
   solution to the global pandemic is vaccination. Unfortunately, the
   hesitancy of receiving vaccines is still high, particularly among
   younger age groups (eg, students). Because the hesitancy of receiving
   vaccines is an important issue, instruments have been developed to
   assess vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, the use of these instruments among
   specific groups such as students is of critical importance. Aim: The
   present study examined the psychometric properties of the nine-item
   MoVac-COVID19S (also known as the DrVac-COVID19S) including its
   measurement invariance among university students in three different
   countries (ie, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Malaysia). Methods: A
   multi-country, web-based cross-sectional survey study was conducted
   among 1809 university students, recruited from the three countries from
   May to September 2021. The nine-item scale was translated into
   Traditional Chinese, Bahasa Indonesian, and Malay. Results: The results
   of the confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the one-factor
   structure of the MoVac-COVID19S was fully supported among Indonesian and
   Malay participants (comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.991 and 0.998;
   Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] = 0.997 and 0.987; root mean sqaure error of
   approximation [RMSEA] = 0.040 and 0.071; and standardized root mean
   square residual [SRMR] = 0.014 and 0.039). Moreover, the four-factor
   structure was supported among Indonesian, Malay, and Taiwanese
   participants (CFI = 0.998, 0.998, and 0.985; TLI = 0.997, 0.996, and
   0.973; RMSEA = 0.044, 0.038, and 0.091; and SRMR = 0.013, 0.018, and
   0.049). Conclusion: The MoVac-COVID19S has good construct validity among
   university students from three different countries (ie, Taiwan,
   Indonesia, and Malaysia). The four-factor structure of the
   MoVac-COVID19S was supported. Therefore, health-care providers may want
   to assess the four underlying constructs to better understand why a
   university student accepts or declines COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the
   three countries. Using the findings, government policymakers and
   health-care authorities can design appropriate programs to help decrease
   vaccine hesitancy.

AB The world is currently going through the COVID-19 pandemic which has
   caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in just a few months. Considering
   the need for lockdown measures, most countries, including Malaysia, have
   implemented Movement Control Orders (MCOs) as a prevention step to
   reduce the deadly spread of this disease. Local and worldwide media have
   reported the immediate improvement of air quality due to this event.
   Nevertheless, data on the effects of MCOs on air quality at local scales
   are still sparse. Here, we investigate changes in air quality during the
   MCO at an urban area using the air sensor network AiRBOXSense which
   measures monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). In this
   study, air pollutant data during normal days were compared with MCO days
   using a reference analyser and AiRBOXSense. The results showed that the
   levels of the measured pollutants dropped by similar to 20 to 60% during
   the MCO days at most locations. However, CO in Kota Damansara (KD)
   dropped to 48.7%, but PM2.5 and PM10 increased up to 60% and 9.7%
   respectively during MCO days. Local burning activities in the
   residential area of KD are believed to be the main cause of the
   increased PM levels. This study has proven that air pollutant levels
   have significantly fallen due to the MCO. This air quality level
   information showed that the reduction of air pollutants can be achieved
   if traffic and industry emissions are strictly controlled.

AB Employee turnover could affect the organisation's performance. Job
   dissatisfaction and burnout have been identified as factors influencing
   the intention to leave. Thus, this study aimed to determine the level of
   intent to leave, and predictors associated with intention to leave among
   medical researchers in Malaysia. A cross-sectional, stratified random
   sampling study was conducted among researchers in a research
   organisation under the Ministry of Health. Respondents answered an
   online questionnaire that included sociodemographic information, job
   dissatisfaction, burnout, and intention to leave. A total of 133
   researchers participated. More than one-third (41.4%) of the researchers
   had a moderate and high level of intention to leave. Burnout and job
   dissatisfaction were identified as significant predictors. Burnout was
   noted to have a positive relationship with the intent to leave (beta =
   0.289, 95% CI (B): 0.287, 1.096). Meanwhile, job satisfaction was found
   to have a negative relationship with the intention to leave (beta =
   -0.348, 95% CI (B): -0.768, -0.273). Burnout among researchers is quite
   worrisome as more than two-thirds of the researchers experienced
   moderate to high burnout. Reducing burnout and job dissatisfaction would
   increase work performance and produce high-quality research output,
   hence decreasing the turnover rate.

AB Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an urgent need to
   develop an automated COVID-19 symptom monitoring system to reduce the
   burden on the health care system and to provide better self-monitoring
   at home.
   Objective: This paper aimed to describe the development process of the
   COVID-19 Symptom Monitoring System (CoSMoS), which consists of a
   self-monitoring, algorithm-based Telegram bot and a teleconsultation
   system. We describe all the essential steps from the clinical
   perspective and our technical approach in designing, developing, and
   integrating the system into clinical practice during the COVID-19
   pandemic as well as lessons learned from this development process.
   Methods: CoSMoS was developed in three phases: (1) requirement formation
   to identify clinical problems and to draft the clinical algorithm, (2)
   development testing iteration using the agile software development
   method, and (3) integration into clinical practice to design an
   effective clinical workflow using repeated simulations and role-playing.
   Results: We completed the development of CoSMoS in 19 days. In Phase 1
   (ie, requirement formation), we identified three main functions: a daily
   automated reminder system for patients to self-check their symptoms, a
   safe patient risk assessment to guide patients in clinical decision
   making, and an active telemonitoring system with real-time phone
   consultations. The system architecture of CoSMoS involved five
   components: Telegram instant messaging, a clinician dashboard, system
   administration (ie, back end), a database, and development and
   operations infrastructure. The integration of CoSMoS into clinical
   practice involved the consideration of COVID-19 infectivity and patient
   safety.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that developing a COVID-19 symptom
   monitoring system within a short time during a pandemic is feasible
   using the agile development method. Time factors and communication
   between the technical and clinical teams were the main challenges in the
   development process. The development process and lessons learned from
   this study can guide the future development of digital monitoring
   systems during the next pandemic, especially in developing countries.

AB Introduction: This study aims to evaluate the knowledge and confidence
   of emergency healthcare workers (EHCW) in facing the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional online study using a validated
   questionnaire was distributed to doctors (MD), assistant medical
   officers (AMO), and staff nurses (SN) at an urban tertiary Emergency
   Department. It comprised of 40 knowledge and 10 confidence-level
   questions related to resuscitation and airway management steps. Results:
   A total of 135 from 167 eligible EHCW were enrolled. 68.9% (n = 93) had
   high knowledge while 53.3% (n = 72) possessed high confidence level.
   Overall knowledge mean score was 32.96/40 (SD = 3.63) between MD (33.88
   +/- 3.09), AMO (32.28 +/- 4.03), and SN (32.00 +/- 13.60), P = 0.025.
   EHCWs with a length of service (LOS) between 4-10 years had the highest
   knowledge compared to those with LOS <4-year (33.71 +/- 3.39 versus
   31.21 +/- 3.19 P = 0.002). Airway-related knowledge was significantly
   different between the designations and LOS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003,
   respectively). Overall, EHCW confidence level against LOS showed
   significant difference [F (2, 132) = 5.46, P = 0.0051 with longer LOS
   showing better confidence. MD showed the highest confidence compared to
   AMO and SN (3.67 +/- 0.69, 3.53 +/- 10.68, 3.26 +/- 0.64) P = 0.049. The
   majority EHCW were confident in performing high-quality
   chest-compression, and handling of Personal Protective Equipment but
   less than half were confident in resuscitating, leading the
   resuscitation, managing the airway or being successful in first
   intubation attempt. Conclusions: EHCW possessed good knowledge in airway
   and resuscitation of COVID-19 patients, but differed between
   designations and LOS. A longer LOS was associated with better
   confidence, but there were some aspects in airway management and
   resuscitation that needed improvement.

AB Aim: To evaluate the COVID-19 vaccination compliance rate and
   post-vaccination Adverse Effects (AEs) among the Dental Health Care
   Workers (DHCW). Materials and Methods: An online, cross-sectional,
   self-administered, structured questionnaire was distributed to 54 DHCW
   at the Faculty of Dentistry, SEGI University to evaluate the demographic
   characteristics, history of infection, type of vaccine received,
   post-vaccination AEs, duration, and hospitalization. In this pilot
   study, a convenience sampling method was adopted and descriptive
   statistics was employed to describe the results. Chi-square test was
   used to compare the post-vaccination AEs among the CoronaVac (R) group,
   Pfizer-BioNTech group and AstraZeneca group and a p-value of less than
   0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: About 85%
   participants had completed the vaccination and one participant tested
   positive for COVID-19 after the first dose. Following the first dose,
   participants in Pfizer-BioNTech (88.9%) and AstraZeneca group (100%),
   experienced higher local AEs (pain and tenderness at the site of
   injection) than the CoronaVac (R) (33.3%) group which was statistically
   significant (P < 0.006). Although higher systemic AEs were observed in
   Pfizer-BioNTech (66.7%) and AstraZeneca vaccine (100%) than the
   CoronaVac (R) (30.6%) group, this was not significant. Similarly, after
   the second dose, higher percentage of participants in the
   Pfizer-BioNTech group experienced systemic (66.7%) and local AEs (66.7%)
   than CoronaVac (R) group. However, this was not significant too. The
   most common systemic AEs were fatigue and myalgia. One participant
   reported a mild allergic reaction and the majority of these AEs resolved
   in 24-48 hours after vaccination, without requiring hospitalization.
   Conclusions: DHCW exhibited a greater compliance rate to Covid-19
   vaccination. Local AEs were more frequently encountered than the
   systemic ones and the common AEs were pain and tenderness at the
   injection site, fatigue, and myalgia. Clinical Significance: Recognizing
   and reporting the AEs of COVID-19 vaccines are imperative to enhance the
   vaccine uptake among the public.

AB Background The computer simulation presented in this study aimed to
   investigate the effect of contact tracing on coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) transmission and infection in the context of rising
   vaccination rates. Methods This study proposed a deterministic,
   compartmental model with contact tracing and vaccination components. We
   defined contact tracing effectiveness as the proportion of contacts of a
   positive case that was successfully traced and the vaccination rate as
   the proportion of daily doses administered per population in Malaysia.
   Sensitivity analyses on the untraced and infectious populations were
   conducted. Results At a vaccination rate of 1.4%, contact tracing with
   an effectiveness of 70% could delay the peak of untraced asymptomatic
   cases by 17 d and reduce it by 70% compared with 30% contact tracing
   effectiveness. A similar trend was observed for symptomatic cases when a
   similar experiment setting was used. We also performed sensitivity
   analyses by using different combinations of contact tracing
   effectiveness and vaccination rates. In all scenarios, the effect of
   contact tracing on COVID-19 incidence persisted for both asymptomatic
   and symptomatic cases. Conclusions While vaccines are progressively
   rolled out, efficient contact tracing must be rapidly implemented
   concurrently to reach, find, test, isolate and support the affected
   populations to bring COVID-19 under control.

   Malaysia Sabah, Malaysia.<bold>Methods: </bold>A cross-sectional study
   was conducted by random sampling among nursing students in Universiti
   Malaysia Sabah between March and May 2021. The primary outcome was
   stress symptoms, derived from the validated Perceived Stress Scale-10
   (PSS) questionnaire. Socio-demographic, social, and environmental
   factors were also assessed. T-test was used to assess the associations
   between level of stress and social and environmental
   factors.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 115 responses were received
   with the mean (SD) age of the students being 20.5 (1.3) years old. Of
   all the students, 84.9% were female, 54.6% received financial support
   from National Higher Education Fund Corporation and 46.2% were in
   nursing Year 2 followed by the nursing year 1 (28.6%) and nursing year 3
   (25.2%). The students in this study reported a higher level of stress.
   The students who reported most or all the time being trapped in a hostel
   (p<0.01), challenges of online classes (p=0.03), and catching up with
   class projects (p=0.03) had a higher level of stress compared to those
   who reported none or little or some of the factors.<bold>Conclusion:
   </bold>This study showed that social and environmental factors may play
   a role in determining the stress level among nursing students. Hence,
   authorities should foster supporting strategies to lower student stress

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of human life. The
   pandemic not only caused millions of fatalities and problems but also
   changed public sentiment and behavior. Owing to the magnitude of this
   pandemic, governments worldwide adopted full lockdown measures that
   attracted much discussion on social media platforms. To investigate the
   effects of these lockdown measures, this study performed sentiment
   analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling on textual data
   from Twitter published during the three lockdown waves in Malaysia
   between 2020 and 2021. Three lockdown measures were identified, the
   related data for the first two weeks of each lockdown were collected and
   analysed to understand the public sentiment. The changes between these
   lockdowns were identified, and the latent topics were highlighted. Most
   of the public sentiment focused on the first lockdown as reflected in
   the large number of latent topics generated during this period. The
   overall sentiment for each lockdown was mostly positive, followed by
   neutral and then negative. Topic modelling results identified staying at
   home, quarantine and lockdown as the main aspects of discussion for the
   first lockdown, whilst importance of health measures and government
   efforts were the main aspects for the second and third lockdowns.
   Governments may utilise these findings to understand public sentiment
   and to formulate precautionary measures that can assure the safety of
   their citizens and tend to their most pressing problems. These results
   also highlight the importance of positive messaging during difficult
   times, establishing digital interventions and formulating new policies
   to improve the reaction of the public to emergency situations.

AB Malaysia has enforced several phases of Movement Control Order (MCO) as
   a quarantine period since 18 March 2020 with the intended purpose of
   containing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. The quarantine
   has affected people's daily lives with frequent job dismissal and
   retrenchment due to the struggling economic conditions of particularly
   small and medium businesses. This study aimed to understand the impact
   of MCO on solid waste management in Serdang, Selangor from the aspects
   of socioeconomic and people's behavior. Solid waste generation data in
   Serdang, Selangor was collected by KDEB Waste Management through waste
   weighing daily throughout 2019 and 2020. The collection was conducted
   according to different housing areas of Serdang. The quantitative
   findings have recorded a decline of 9.94% in solid waste data generation
   subjected to COVID-19 lockdown. In conjunction with that, an online
   questionnaire participated by 310 respondents was conducted on
   understanding the effect of the lockdown on people's behavior and
   socioeconomic aspect with respect to solid waste management. This study
   revealed that June onwards (after MCO Phase 1) generated the most solid
   waste. Indeed, solid waste generation due to MCO according to the waste
   refusal behavior is the consensus in favor of Malaysia's appropriate
   need for stricter policies.

AB AimWe examined the anxiety levels and coping strategies among staff and
   students of a tertiary educational institution during the COVID-19
   pandemic and determined the association between anxiety level and coping
   strategies. MethodThrough an online survey, we used Coronavirus Anxiety
   Scale (CAS) to measure the level of anxiety associated with the COVID-19
   crisis and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) to
   assess the coping responses adopted to handle stressful life events.
   Coping strategies were classified as adaptive and maladaptive, for which
   the aggregate sores were calculated. Multiple linear regression was used
   to determine the predictors of anxiety adjusted for potentially
   confounding variables. Results from 434 participants were available for
   analysis. ResultsThe mean score (SD) of the CAS was 1.1 (1.8). The mean
   scores of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies were 35.69 and
   19.28, respectively. Multiple linear regression revealed that
   maladaptive coping [Adjusted B coefficient = 4.106, p-value < 0.001] and
   presence of comorbidities [Adjusted B coefficient = 1.376, p-value =
   0.025] significantly predicted anxiety. ConclusionMaladaptive coping and
   presence of comorbidities were the predictors of coronavirus anxiety.
   The apparent lack of anxiety in relation to COVID-19 and movement
   restriction is reflective of the reported high level of satisfaction
   with the support and services provided during the COVID-19 outbreak in
   Malaysia. Adaptive coping strategies were adopted more frequently than
   maladaptive. Nevertheless, public education on positive coping
   strategies and anxiety management may be still be relevant to provide
   mental health support to address the needs of the general population.

AB Job satisfaction and its antecedents and outcomes are important areas of
   focus in the social sciences research, and higher education is no
   exception. The importance of this issue has grown during the COVID-19
   pandemic. For this reason, using a cross-national study conducted in
   Malaysia and Japan, we collected data on lecturers' job satisfaction and
   two of its outcomes, namely, academic motivation and individual-level
   organizational citizenship behavior (OCBI) to test our evidence-based
   theoretical model, which explains the relationships between these
   variables. We also added age, gender, and tenure as covariates to our
   model. Our partial least squares structural equation modeling estimation
   results at the aggregate and country levels showed that the effect of
   job satisfaction on OCBI was mainly transmitted through academic
   motivation. We also observed that Malaysian and Japanese lecturers did
   not show a statistical difference in terms of the relationships
   described between the variables in our model. Additionally, the
   relationship between academic motivation and OCBI was nonlinear based on
   the data from the Malaysian sample, and we explained this phenomenon
   from both theoretical and practical/policy perspectives. Moreover, our
   results showed that age plays an important role in the model when it is
   estimated using data from the Malaysian higher education system. We
   discussed our findings in detail in terms of theoretical and practical
   implications.

AB The second wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia is largely attributed to a
   four-day mass gathering held in Sri Petaling from February 27, 2020,
   which contributed to an exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in the
   country. Starting from March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government
   introduced four consecutive phases of a Movement Control Order (MCO) to
   stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO was implemented through various
   non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases
   reached its peak by the first week of April and then started to reduce,
   hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative
   understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this
   paper develops a class of mathematical models to capture the disease
   spread before and after MCO implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous
   variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model is
   developed with additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission.
   Further, a change-point is incorporated to model disease dynamics before
   and after intervention which is inferred based on data. Related
   statistical analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework
   and are able to provide quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of
   the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing
   transmission during the MCO period. The analysis here also
   quantitatively demonstrates how quickly transmission rates fall under
   effective NPI implementation within a short time period. The models and
   methodology used provided important insights into the nature of local
   transmissions to decision makers in the Ministry of Health, Malaysia.

AB Social Sustainability among university students, especially how students
   deal with psychological distress, is important during the COVID-19
   pandemic. This study examines the relationship between perceived social
   support and coping strategies and the psychological distress of
   depression, anxiety, and stress among the students of the Public
   University in Sabah during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the
   level of depression, anxiety, and stress among the students. The
   inclusion criteria were: (1) currently an active status university
   student; (2) absent of visual disability; (3) absent of network coverage
   issues; and (4) absent of clinical symptoms of psychological distress.
   The total respondents were 385 students from this university who ranged
   from 20 to 23 years of age and were collected from all the faculties
   available at the main campus of Public University in Kota Kinabalu,
   Sabah, Malaysia. The research method applied was a survey method,
   collecting the data through an online questionnaire platform. Three
   instruments were used: (1) Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
   (DASS-21); (2) Brief COPE Scale (Brief COPE); and (3) Multidimensional
   Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The result of the descriptive
   analysis indicated that the levels of both depression and anxiety in
   students of the Public University in Sabah were mild. In contrast, the
   stress level was moderate during the pandemic. The results of the
   inferential analysis indicated the relationship between perceived social
   support and psychological distress, which focused on depression, anxiety
   and stress among the university students, to overall having a
   significantly negative correlation between its subscales (r = between
   -0.148 and -0.359; p < 0.05). Based on the findings, it is clear how
   vulnerable university students are to psychological distress during the
   COVID-19 pandemic, but it can be overcome with social support and
   suitable types of coping strategy. Besides, a negative link between
   depression and problem-focused coping was reported (r = -0.274, p <
   0.05). These findings also contribute to social sustainability and the
   wellbeing of students at the Public University in Sabah, Malaysia.

   industry. The main objective was to examine the impact of the pandemic
   and the subsequent MCO on the various business aspects of the SMEs as
   well as to make recommendations to the government on supportive measures
   for the SMEs. The survey found that although all aspects of the business
   were impacted, the two major concerns of the SMEs during this crisis
   were the financial management and the supply chain disruptions.
   Inevitably, it was found that most of the SMEs were operating well below
   capacity, which was a huge financial strain on their business viability.
   It was recommended that the government provide measures to help the SMEs
   manage their cash-flow and ease the restrictions to facilitate
   supply-chain commencement that is crucial to their business. The survey
   also revealed that most SMEs acknowledged the importance of automation
   and the adoption of technologies. Respondents regarded the shift towards
   Industry 4.0 was inevitable as a means increase their resilience when

   been facing an immense change from traditional in-person classroom
   education to virtual education to alleviate its impact. Hence, the
   present study is designed to examine the impact of teachers'
   self-efficacy and system quality on teachers' continuance commitment
   towards online teaching in the COVID-19. Also, teachers' mental
   well-being has been added as a moderating variable. During a crisis like
   COVID, teachers are expected to show higher engagement through
   commitment. Both in Malaysia and Pakistan, the degree of loyalty in the
   teaching profession is a distinguishing characteristic. Hence, teachers
   of both countries are targeted for the comparative analysis. The results
   depict that the e-learning system quality and instructors' self-efficacy
   are critical factors in making the teachers willing to continue their
   online practices. However, assurance and educational quality do not play
   a significant role in the context of Pakistan. However, in the Malaysian
   context, results differ and reveal that instructors' responsiveness and
   information quality do not play a promising role.

AB Research identifying adults' mental health during the coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic relies solely on demographic predictors
   without examining adults' health condition as a potential predictor.
   This study aims to examine individuals' perception of health conditions
   and test availability as potential predictors of mental health-insomnia,
   anxiety, depression, and distress-during the COVID-19 pandemic. An
   online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during 2-8 May
   2020, six weeks after the Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued. We
   found adults' perception of health conditions had curvilinear
   relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with insomnia, anxiety,
   depression, and distress. Perceived test availability for COVID-19 also
   had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with
   anxiety and depression. Younger adults reported worse mental health, but
   people from various religions and ethnic groups did not differ
   significantly in reported mental health. The results indicated that
   adults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, and
   the worse degree deepened for unhealthy people. Perceived test
   availability negatively predicted anxiety and depression, especially for
   adults perceiving COVID-19 test unavailability. The significant
   predictions of perceived health condition and perceived COVID-19 test
   availability suggest a new direction for the literature to identify the
   psychiatric risk factors directly from health-related variables during a
   pandemic.

AB Objectives: Patient satisfaction was used as an indicator of service
   quality in the public hospitals. The pharmacy value-added services (VAS)
   were intensified after the COVID-19 outbreak, and evaluation of user's
   satisfaction was important for service improvement.
   Methods: This was a single-centre, cross-sectional, web-based study in
   the outpatient pharmacy in a tertiary hospital in the Perak state of
   Malaysia. Patients and caregivers aged 18 years and above, received at
   least one prescription refill using the pharmacy VAS from April to
   September 2020, were included. The questionnaire was adapted from a
   validated tool, underwent face and content validation before
   dissemination. The link was disseminated to the targeted population
   through short messages service (SMS).
   Key findings: Out of 1200 invited people, 303 agreed to participate.
   Majority of the respondents were male (160, 52.8%), Chinese (156,
   51.5%), with tertiary education (201, 66.3%) and retiree (112, 37.0%).
   Out of a maximum score of 5, the overall mean satisfaction score was
   4.42 (SD: 0.55). The respondents were most agreeable to time-saving
   benefits of the pharmacy VAS (4.56 +/- 0.63). Majority of the
   respondents felt that pharmacy VAS had made their life easier (290,
   95.7%) and planned to recommend the pharmacy VAS to others (292, 96.4%)
   Respondents aged more than 60 (versus age 18-35, beta = 2.375, P <
   0.001) and those who used drive-through service (versus SPUB, beta =
   2.272, P = 0.001) reported higher satisfaction scores. Several
   suggestions were made for service improvement, including longer
   operating hours (18, 6.0%), upgraded communication system (9, 3.0%),
   smoother registration process (9, 3.0%), more polite staff (9, 3.0%),
   selection of preferred postage delivery time (6, 2.0%) and promotion of
   VAS (4, 1.3%)
   Conclusions: Majority of the respondents were highly satisfied towards
   the pharmacy VAS. Future studies should compare the satisfaction of VAS
   with traditional counter service to compare the level and factors that
   contributed to the users' satisfaction.

   placed heavy emphasis on online learning in connection with new
   technological advances as a mode of interaction to substitute direct
   conventional instruction. The aim of this research is to determine
   student acceptability of e-learning implementation following COVID-19 in
   a pondok school in Kelantan. This study is intended to ascertain the
   implications of students' characteristics and technology-acceptance
   models as well as the moderation effect of familiarity with technology
   on their future behavioural intentions to use e-learning. This research
   used a quantitative technique and included 100 students from a pondok
   school in Kelantan. Self-administered questionnaires were used to gather
   data. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was
   used in the data analysis. Outcomes from this study showed that
   students' characteristics are positively affected by their motivation,
   mindset, and computer competency. Perceived ease of use and perceived
   usefulness positively affect technology adoption. On the other hand,
   economic deprivation negatively affects technology adoption.
   Furthermore, students' characteristics and technology adoption
   positively affect the behavioural intent to continuously engage in
   e-learning in the future. However, familiarity with technology does not
   moderate the relationship between a student characteristics and
   intention nor between the technology acceptance model and a student's
   intention to use e-learning.

   migrant workers, especially the Rohingya refugees. We argue that they
   are all not in contradictory of each other, but in actual fact, glued by
   populist narratives of local leaders. The relativist approach, using the
   qualitative content analysis method was adopted to better understand the
   underlying factors which led to these manifestations of hate captured
   online and sometimes its spillover effects expressed in real life. This
   study concludes that there is an abstract corelation between populist
   exclusionary statements by political leaders and the responding hate
   speech sentiments being shared online during the pandemic.

AB Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread so widely across borders
   and worldwide. All countries, including Malaysia, need to take immediate
   and aggressive action to curb and combat this virus by accurately
   predicting the number of new COVID-19 cases a few weeks in advance. This
   paper aims to present robust traditional methods that can be used to
   make accurate predictions for the evolution of an epidemic over the next
   two weeks. Methodology: There are two traditional methods for
   forecasting, such as ARIMA and LR. We use COVID-19 daily data in
   Malaysia from 1 January 2021 to 14 January 2022, and use Microsoft
   Excel, Minitab, and SPSS software version 26 to perform the forecasting
   procedure. Results: The ARIMA model showed a slight difference between
   the forecast value and the actual value of the new COVID-19 case
   compared to the forecast value for the LR model. This indicates that the
   efficient and usable prediction model is the ARIMA model with high
   adj-R2 values and low MAD, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE values. Conclusions:
   Accurately predicting trends is an important aspect of preventing the
   spread of COVID-19 outbreaks, especially in countries with large
   populations. Furthermore, accurate forecasts can provide feedback on
   whether the policies implemented effectively relieve the pressures of
   the national healthcare system and enable the government to evaluate
   different strategies for risk reduction and to regulate different
   policies based on projections of different areas of concern.

AB Problem: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
   adversely affected the preparation of Malaysia's National Health and
   Morbidity Survey for 2020 because conducting it would expose data
   collectors and participants to an increased risk of infection.
   Context: The survey is nationally representative and community based and
   is conducted by the Institute for Public Health, part of the National
   Institutes of Health, to generate health-related evidence and to support
   the Malaysian Ministry of Health in policymaking. Its planned scope for
   2020 was the seroprevalence of communicable diseases such as hepatitis B
   and C.
   Action: Additional components were added to the survey to increase its
   usefulness, including COVID-19 seroprevalence and facial anthropometric
   studies to ensure respirator fit. The survey's scale was reduced, and
   data collection was changed from including only face-to-face interviews
   to mainly self-administered and telephone interviews. The transmission
   risk to participants was reduced by screening data collectors before the
   survey and fortnightly thereafter, using standard droplet and contact
   precautions, ensuring proper training and monitoring of data collectors,
   and implementing other administrative infection prevention measures.
   Outcome: Data were collected from 7 August to 11 October 2020, with 5957
   participants recruited. Only 4 out of 12 components of the survey were
   conducted via face-to-face interview. No COVID-19 cases were reported
   among data collectors and participants. All participants were given
   their hepatitis and COVID-19 laboratory test results; 73 participants
   with hepatitis B and 14 with hepatitis C who had been previously
   undiagnosed were referred for further case management.
   Discussion: Preparing and conducting the National Health and Morbidity
   Survey during the COVID-19 pandemic required careful consideration of
   the risks and benefits, multiple infection prevention measures, strong
   leadership and strong stakeholder support to ensure there were no
   adverse events.

AB Objectives To understand the impact of COVID-19 and public health
   measures on different social groups, we conducted a mixed-methods study
   in five countries ('SEBCOV-social, ethical and behavioural aspects of
   COVID-19'). Here, we report the results of the online survey. Study
   design and statistical analysis Overall, 5058 respondents from Thailand,
   Malaysia, the UK, Italy and Slovenia completed the self-administered
   survey between May and June 2020. Poststratification weighting was
   applied, and associations between categorical variables assessed.
   Frequency counts and percentages were used to summarise categorical
   data. Associations between categorical variables were assessed using
   Pearson's chi(2) test. Data were analysed in Stata 15.0 Results Among
   the five countries, Thai respondents reported having been most, and
   Slovenian respondents least, affected economically. The following
   factors were associated with greater negative economic impacts: being
   18-24 years or 65 years or older; lower education levels; larger
   households; having children under 18 in the household and and having
   flexible/no income. Regarding social impact, respondents expressed most
   concern about their social life, physical health, mental health and
   well-being. There were large differences between countries in terms of
   voluntary behavioural change, and in compliance and agreement with
   COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, self-reported compliance was higher
   among respondents who self-reported a high understanding of COVID-19. UK
   respondents felt able to cope the longest and Thai respondents the
   shortest with only going out for essential needs or work. Many
   respondents reported seeing news perceived to be fake, the proportion
   varying between countries, with education level and self-reported levels
   of understanding of COVID-19. Conclusions Our data showed that COVID-19
   and public health measures have uneven economic and social impacts on
   people from different countries and social groups. Understanding the
   factors associated with these impacts can help to inform future public
   health interventions and mitigate their negative consequences.

AB Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have been associated with
   enhanced transmissibility and immune escape. Next-generation sequencing
   (NGS) of the whole genome is the gold standard for variant
   identification for surveillance but is time-consuming and costly. Rapid
   and cost-effective assays that detect SARS-CoV2 variants are needed. We
   evaluated Allplex SARS-CoV-2 Master Assay and Variants I Assay to detect
   HV69/70 deletion, Y144 deletion, E484K, N501Y, and P681H spike mutations
   in 248 positive samples collected in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between
   January and May 2021. Spike variants were detected in 78/248 (31.5 %),
   comprising 60 VOC B.1.351 (beta) and 18 B.1.1.7 (alpha). With NGS as
   reference for 115 samples, the sensitivity for detecting the spike
   mutations was 98.7 % with the Master Assay and 100 % with the Variants I
   Assay. The emergence of beta variants correlated with increasing
   COVID-19 infections in Malaysia. The prevalence of alpha VOC and lineage
   B.1.466.2 was low. These assays detect mutations present in alpha, beta
   and gamma VOCs. Of the VOCs which have subsequently emerged, the assays
   should detect omicron (B.1.1.529) but not B.1.617.2 (delta). In
   conclusion, spike variant PCR assays can be used to rapidly monitor
   selected SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in resource-limited settings, but require
   updates as new variants emerge.

AB SARS-CoV-2 has spread throughout the world since its discovery in China,
   and Malaysia is no exception. WGS has been a crucial approach in
   studying the evolution and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the
   ongoing pandemic. Despite considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 genome
   sequences have been submitted to GISAID and NCBI databases, there is
   still scarcity of data from Malaysia. This study aims to report new
   Malaysian lineages of the virus, responsible for the sustained spikes in
   COVID-19 cases during the third wave of the pandemic. Patients with
   nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs confirmed COVID-19 positive by
   real-time RT PCR with C-T value < 25 were chosen for WGS. The selected
   SARS-CoV-2 isolates were then sequenced, characterized and analyzed
   along with 986 sequences of the dominant lineages of D614G variants
   currently circulating throughout Malaysia. The prevalence of Glade GH
   and G formed strong ground for the presence of two Malaysian lineages of
   AU.2 and B.1.524 that has caused sustained spikes of cases in the
   country. Statistical analysis on the association of gender and age group
   with Malaysian lineages revealed a significant association (p <0.05).
   Phylogenetic analysis revealed dispersion of 41 lineages, of these, 22
   lineages are still active. Mutational analysis showed presence of unique
   G1223C missense mutation in transmembrane domain of the spike protein.
   For better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Malaysia
   especially with reference to the reported lineages, large scale studies
   based on WGS are warranted.

AB This study has highlighted the trend of recently-reported dengue cases
   after the implementation of the Movement Control Orders (MCOs) caused
   due to COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The researchers used the dengue
   surveillance data published by the Malaysian Ministry of Health during
   the 3 phases of MCO (which ranged between 17th March 2020 and 28th April
   2020) was used for determining the cumulative number of dengue patients.
   Thereafter, the dengue cases were mapped using the Geographical
   Information System (GIS). The results indicated that during the 42 days
   of MCO in Peninsular Malaysia, 11,242 total cases of dengue were
   reported. The daily trend of the dengue cases showed a decrease from
   7268 cases that occurred before the MCOs to 4662 dengue cases that
   occurred during the initial 14 days of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., MCO
   I), to 3075 cases occurring during the MCO II and 3505 dengue cases
   noted during MCO III. The central peninsular region showed a maximal
   decrease in new dengue cases (52.62%), followed by the northern
   peninsular region (1.89%); eastern coastal region (1.25%) and the
   southern peninsular region (1.14%) during the initial MCO
   implementation. However, an increase in the new dengue cases was noted
   during the MCO III period, wherein all states showed an increase in the
   new dengue cases as compared during MCO II. The decrease in the pattern
   was not solely based on the MCO, hence, further investigation is
   necessary after considering different influencing factors. These results
   have important implication for future large-scale risk assessment,
   planning and hazard mitigation on dengue management.

AB IntroductionInfluenza is a common respiratory virus which leads to over
   400,000 annual deaths globally. Mortality from influenza is highest
   among those aged 75 years and over living in Africa and Southeast Asia.
   ObjectiveTo determine the burden of influenza among older adults
   presenting to public hospitals with severe acute respiratory infection
   (SARI) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
   MethodsThis multi-center, prospective, observational study recruited
   individuals aged 65 years and over who presented to four Malaysian
   hospitals with SARI from 1 January to 31 December 2021. Those with prior
   confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   infection were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 was detected through real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with routine diagnostic kits. Influenza
   A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viruses were
   detected with Xpress Flu/RSV kits using the GeneXpert rapid real-time
   PCR system (Cepheid, USA). ResultsSamples were obtained from 512
   participants, comprising 296 (57.8%) men and 216 (42.2%) women, with a
   mean age (SD) of 74.0 (7.1) years. Inpatient death occurred in 48 (9.6%)
   individuals. Significant differences existed in age, ethnicity, and
   comorbidities across study sites. One (0.2%) case of influenza A, two
   (0.4%) cases of RSV and 63 (12.5%) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were
   detected over the 1-year period. Cases of COVID-19 mirrored national
   trends derived from open source data, while the dearth of influenza
   cases mirrored national and global Flunet figures. ConclusionOur
   observational study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic detected only
   one case of influenza, alongside a high SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate. The
   poor uptake of influenza vaccination nationally, worsened by the recent
   pandemic restrictions, could lead to waning immunity from the absence of
   seasonal exposure. Potentially deadly outbreaks may then occur when
   lockdown and infection control measures are eventually removed.

AB Introduction: COVID-19 has affected almost every country in the world,
   which causing many negative implications in terms of education, economy
   and mental health. Worryingly, the trend of second or third wave of the
   pandemic has been noted in multiple regions despite early success of
   flattening the curve, such as in the case of Malaysia, post Sabah state
   election in September 2020. Hence, it is imperative to predict ongoing
   trend of COVID-19 to assist crucial policymaking in curbing the
   transmission.
   Method: Generalized logistic growth modelling (GLM) approach was adopted
   to make prediction of growth of cases according to each state in
   Malaysia. The data was obtained from official Ministry of Health
   Malaysia daily report, starting from 26 September 2020 until 1 January
   2021.
   Result: Sabah, Johor, Selangor and Kuala Lumpur are predicted to exceed
   10,000 cumulative cases by 2 February 2021. Nationally, the growth
   factor has been shown to range between 0.25 to a peak of 3.1 throughout
   the current Movement Control Order (MCO). The growth factor range for
   Sabah ranged from 1.00 to 1.25, while Selangor, the state which has the
   highest case, has a mean growth factor ranging from 1.22 to 1.52. The
   highest growth rates reported were inWP Labuan for the time periods of
   22 Nov - 5 Dec 2020 with growth rates of 4.77. States with higher
   population densities were predicted to have higher cases of COVID-19.
   Conclusion: GLM is helpful to provide governments and policymakers with
   accurate and helpful forecasts on magnitude of epidemic and peak time.
   This forecast could assist government in devising short- and long-term
   plan to tackle the ongoing pandemic. (C) 2021 The Authors. Publishing

   wavelet analysis technique. The daily data on selected variables were
   collected from 1 January 2020, to 10 June 2021. Empirical investigation
   was made with wavelet analysis along with the Toda-Yamamoto test. The
   results revealed the significant response of both indexes to the oil
   price. Such response was negative for the short- and medium terms;
   however, it became positive in the long run. Our research has several
   important implications and recommendations for asset managers and
   policymakers. Policymakers and regulators should promote awareness and
   adopt effective action plans to minimize the risk of change in oil
   prices during the COVID-19 period. This research will enable investors,
   scholars, and policymakers to improve their current structure and
   prepare them for any potential future crisis.

AB Objectives: In this study, we aimed to investigate vaccine effectiveness
   (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infections among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years
   in Malaysia and examine potential VE differences after full vaccination.
   Methods: We consolidated data on COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and
   outcomes for all public schoolgoing adolescents in Malaysia from
   September 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021, and estimated the VE against
   SARS-CoV-2 infections during this period. Cases were defined as positive
   tests, either by reverse transcriptase- PCR (RT-PCR) or rapid antigen
   (RTK-Ag) testing, while controls were negative tests. Secondarily, we
   restricted the analysis to all tests performed in December 2021 and
   compared VE by month of full vaccination.
   Results: A total of 175,880 eligible tests (53.4% or 93,995 RT-PCR
   tests) were included. After full vaccination with BNT162b2, VE against
   SARS-CoV-2 infections was 65.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.4,
   66.9) over the study period. When restricted to tests in December 2021,
   VEs for those fully vaccinated in September 2021, October 2021, and
   November 2021 were comparable (60.6% [95% CI 23.7, 81.5], 56.9% [95% CI
   51.1, 62.0], and 65.7% [95% CI 59.8, 70.7] respectively).
   Conclusions: Among adolescents, full vaccination with BNT162b2 offered
   considerable protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections over at least
   three months without substantial evidence of waning. (C) 2022 The

AB Bronchial asthma among children is a common chronic disease that may
   impact quality of life. Health education is one of the strategies to
   improve knowledge and quality of life. This study aims to assess the
   effect of health education via a mobile application in promoting the
   quality of life among schoolchildren with asthma in urban Malaysia
   during the COVID-19 era. A quasi-experimental, pre- and
   post-intervention design was used in this study involving a total of 214
   students, randomly assigned into two groups (an intervention group and a
   control group). The control group received face-to-face health
   education, whereas the experimental group received health education via
   a mobile application. The findings showed that the total score of
   quality of life improved from a mean total score at pre-intervention of
   5.31 +/- 1.27 to post-intervention of 5.66 +/- 1.28 for the control
   group, compared with the experimental group with a mean total score of
   quality of life at pre-intervention of 5.01 +/- 1.36 and
   post-intervention of 5.85 +/- 1.29. A comparison between the
   experimental and control groups using an independent t test showed
   statistically significant differences in their mean quality of life
   scores. The effect of health education via a mobile application showed a
   statistically significant improvement in the mean quality of life score
   from pre- to post-intervention (F-1,F-288 = 57.46, P < .01). As
   recommended, the use of mobile technology in health education improved
   the quality of life of schoolchildren with asthma as compared with the
   traditional methods of a face-to-face lecture and/or a handbook. Thus,
   educational modules using mobile applications do improve quality of
   life.

AB Objective This cross-sectional observational study summarized the
   baseline characteristics of subjects who underwent COVID-19 molecular
   testing in a private medical centre located in the state of Selangor in
   Malaysia between 1 Oct 2020 and 31 Jan 2021. We compared the baseline
   characteristics between subjects who were tested positive and negative
   of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identified risk factors which may be
   predictive of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Methods and findings A total of
   36603 subjects who were tested for COVID-19 infection via molecular
   assays at Sunway Medical Centre between Oct 1, 2020 and Jan 31, 2021,
   and consented to participate in this observation study were included for
   analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize the study cohort,
   whereas logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors
   associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Among the reasons listed for
   COVID-19 screening were those who needed clearance for travelling,
   clearance to return to work, or clearance prior to hospital admission.
   They accounted for 67.7% of tested subjects, followed by the
   self-referred group (27.3%). Most of the confirmed cases were
   asymptomatic (62.6%), had no travel history (99.6%), and had neither
   exposure to SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases (61.9%) nor exposure to patients
   under investigation (82.7%) and disease clusters (89.2%). Those who
   presented with loss of smell or taste (OR: 26.91; 95% CI: 14.81-48.92,
   p<0.001), fever (OR:3.97; 95% CI: 2.54-6.20, p<0.001), running nose (OR:
   1.75; 95% CI:1.10-2.79, p = 0.019) or other symptoms (OR: 5.63; 95%
   CI:1.68-18.91, p = 0.005) were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2
   positivity in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusion
   Our study showed that majority of patients seeking COVID-19 testing in a
   private healthcare setting were mainly asymptomatic with low
   epidemiological risk. Consequently, the average positivity rate was 1.2%
   compared to the national cumulative positivity rate of 4.65%. Consistent
   with other studies, we found that loss of smell or taste, fever and
   running nose were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We believe that
   strengthening the capacity of private health institutions is important
   in the national battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the
   importance of public-private partnership to improve the quality of
   clinical care.

   interventions (NPIs), including social distancing, travel restrictions
   and quarantine, on lived experiences during the first wave of the
   COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand (TH), Malaysia (MY), Italy (IT) and the
   United Kingdom (UK). A total of 86 interviews (TH: n = 28; MY: n = 18;
   IT: n = 20; UK: n = 20) were conducted with members of the public,
   including healthcare workers (n = 13). Participants across countries
   held strong views on government imposed NPIs, with many feeling measures
   lacked clarity. Most participants reported primarily negative impacts of
   NPIs on their lives, including through separation, isolation and grief
   over missed milestones; work-related challenges and income loss; and
   poor mental health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, many also experienced
   inadvertent positive consequences, including more time at home to focus
   on what they most valued in life; a greater sense of connectedness; and
   benefits to working life. Commonly employed coping strategies focused on
   financial coping (e.g. reducing spending); psycho-emotional coping (e.g.
   engaging in spiritual practices); social coping and connectedness (e.g.,
   maintaining relationships remotely); reducing and mitigating risks
   (e.g., changing food shopping routines); and limiting exposure to the
   news (e.g., checking news only occasionally). Importantly, the extent to
   which participants' lived experiences were positive or negative, and
   their ability to cope was underpinned by individual, social and economic
   factors, with the analysis indicating some salient differences across
   countries and participants. In order to mitigate negative and unequal
   impacts of NPIs, COVID-19 policies will benefit from paying closer
   attention to the social, cultural and psychological-not just
   biological-vulnerabilities to, and consequences of public health
   measures.

AB Introduction: Like many other countries, the federal government of
   Malaysia took the initiative to implement nationwide home confinement as
   a preventive measure in response to the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak,
   better known as Movement Control Order (MCO). Many have suffered
   economically, which led to poor states of well-being. This study
   investigates the relationship between lifestyle, psychological factors
   affecting eating habits, and physical activity among government servants
   in states with the highest cumulative cases during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among
   210 government servants from four states (Selangor, Sabah, Kuala Lumpur,
   and Johor) from May 2021 to June 2021. Three validated questionnaires
   were used, namely, Emotional-Eater Questionnaire (EEQ), and Malay
   International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-M) from Lopez-Moreno
   et al. (1). Results: There were significant gender differences (P <
   0.001) for supplement intake, with 30.4% among men and 62.3% in women.
   Almost half (49.1%) were classified as emotional or very emotional
   eaters. Also, a significant difference (P < 0.005) was found in the
   perception of boredom and apathy between men (35.7%) and women (31.8%).
   A majority (56.2%) stated that their mood positively affected their
   eating habits. The total metabolic equivalent of task (MET) for 132
   subjects was 3495.8 & PLUSMN; 3862.7 min/week for physical activity.
   Significant differences were observed between MET and gender
   (Mann-Whitney U-test: P = 0.019), with men showing higher MET value
   (5001.4 +/- 5354.0 min/week men, 2864.3 +/- 2754.3 min/week women). A
   significant difference was observed among women for body weight and body
   mass index (BMI) before and during MCO (P < 0.001). For the emotional
   eater, there were correlations with eating habits before the MCO for
   quantity of food intake (P = 0.003), frequency of mealtime (P < 0.001),
   changes of food habits (P = 0.005), cooking methods (P = 0.016), and
   frequency of food intake (P = 0.020). There is no correlation (P =
   0.577) between psychological factors affecting eating habits and
   physical activity during COVID-19. Conclusion: Changes were reported
   before and during MCO on lifestyle, eating habits, and physical
   activity. Such information will help design strategies to improve the
   economic and health status among government servants in Malaysia during
   the implementation of MCO or something similar.

   literacy (FL) and financial behaviour (FB) with health-related quality
   of life (HRQOL) during the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income working
   population (20-60 years old) in Malaysia. A self-administered
   questionnaire survey was used with HRQOL data were gathered using the
   EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) tool. A generalised linear model
   was employed to examine the hypothesised relationships between the
   constructs. From 1186 respondents, the majority were employed (73.9%),
   had a monthly household income of less than RM 2500 (74.5%), and did not
   have any chronic medical conditions (74.5%). The mean (SD) values of FL,
   FB, and EQ-5D-5L were 5.95 (1.48), 22.08 (4.79), and 0.96 (0.10),
   respectively. The results of the adjusted model revealed lower age
   group, Malay ethnicity, Indian ethnicity, and increased FB score as
   significant determinants of higher EQ-5D-5L scores. With the addition of
   the chronic medical condition factor into the saturated model, the lower
   age group, ethnicity, and no chronic medical condition were significant
   determinants of higher HRQOL. The effects of FB on QOL were confounded
   by chronic diseases, implying that interventions that focus on improving
   FB for those with chronic medical condition may help to improve the QOL
   among the low-income working population.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns have adversely impacted
   children on the autism spectrum and their families, especially in
   Malaysia where this population is often marginalized. The current
   quantitative research aimed to investigate the impact of the Malaysian
   COVID-19 lockdown on the behavior and psychological distress of children
   formally diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) as well as
   the psychological distress and well-being of their parents, in
   comparison with a typically developing (TD) control group.
   Methods: The children's ages ranged between 5 and 17 years. The sample
   included 72 ASC parent-child dyads and 62 TD parent-child dyads. The
   primary caregiver completed an online survey including the following:
   demographic and diagnostic information; ASC symptoms; children's
   inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, perceived stress, depression,
   and anxiety; parents' perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and
   well-being based on their experience pre- and mid-lockdown (March 18th
   to June 9th 2020) in Malaysia.
   Results: Among the ASC group, no significant pre- and mid-lockdown
   change was found in ASC symptoms (p > 0.05). There were no significant
   gender differences (boys/girls) in all the child scales. The 2
   [diagnosis (ASC, TD)] x 2 [lockdown (pre-lockdown, mid-lockdown)]
   mixed-model ANOVAs revealed main effects of lockdown on children's
   attention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, anxiety, and parents' perceived
   stress, depression, and psychological well-being (p < 0.005). There was
   a main effect of diagnosis in all child and parent variables, except
   parents' perceived stress (p >0.005). However, there was no significant
   interaction effect between diagnosis and lockdown (p >0.005). All child
   behavior (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) and child
   psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and perceived stress) were
   significantly correlated in both the ASC and TD groups (p < 0.005). On
   the other hand, only some of the parent variables were significantly
   correlated with child variables (p < 0.0045) in the ASC group while none
   of the parent variables were significantly correlated with the child
   variables (p > 0.005) in the TD group.
   Conclusion: The results provide preliminary evidence indicating negative
   effects of the Malaysian lockdown on both children on the autism
   spectrum and TD children, as well as their parents. These quantitative
   results will be triangulated with the qualitative interview data to
   provide a holistic understanding of the impact of the pandemic,
   informing translational policy and practice recommendations.

AB Malaysia recorded its first case of COVID-19 on January 24th, 2020 with
   a stable number of reported cases until March 2020, where there was an
   exponential spike due to a massive religious gathering in Kuala Lumpur.
   This caused Malaysia to be the hardest hit COVID-19 country in South
   East Asia at the time. In order to curb the transmission and better
   managed the clusters, Malaysia imposed the Movement Control Order (MCO)
   which is now in its fourth phase. The MCO together with targeted
   screening have slowed the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. The government
   has also provided three economic stimulus packages in order to cushion
   the impact of the shrinking economy. Nonetheless, early studies have
   shown that the MCO would greatly affect the lower and medium income
   groups, together with small and medium businesses. (C) 2020 The

AB The emergence of a third wave of COVID-19 infection in Malaysia since
   September 2020 has led to imminent changes in public health prevention
   and control measures. As high as 96.2% of registered COVID-19 cases and
   88.5% of confirmed deaths in Malaysia occurred during this third wave of
   infection. A phylogenomic study on 258 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes from
   February 2020-February 2021 has led to the discovery of a novel
   Malaysian lineage B.1.524. This lineage contains another spike mutation
   A701V that co-exists with the D614G spike mutation that was predominant
   in most of the third-wave clusters. The study provides vital genomic
   insights on the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 variants in Malaysia in
   conjunction with the presence of a dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage during
   the third wave of COVID-19 infection.

AB Rapid sequence incubation (RSI) is a procedural skill that house
   officers (HO) in Malaysia need to learn during their training in
   emergency department (ED) posting. This study aimed to evaluate the
   confidence and competency of HO in RSI after completed training in the
   ED of a university hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. A prospective
   cross-sectional study was conducted among 44 HO. When they begin their
   posting in ED, a pre-test was done with a questionnaire to evaluate
   their knowledge and confidence level. A post-test was conducted three
   months later with a similar questionnaire. They underwent an objective
   structured clinical examination to evaluate their skill. A feedback
   survey form was filled in by the HO regarding their satisfaction in
   training in emergency rotation. The mean score for pre-test and posttest
   were 8.75 +/- 3.005 and 14.86 +/- 2.258, respectively (P = 0.000). There
   was an improvement in knowledge level and confidence level between
   pre-test and post-test (all P = 0.000). 43.2% were competent in
   knowledge, while 65.9% were competent in skill. 35 house officersfilled
   in the feedback survey form. It showed that 42.9% (n =15) were very
   satisfied and 28.6% (n = 10) were satisfied with the training in ED.
   There was an improvement in knowledge and confidence level in RSI among
   the HO after ED rotation. The clinical exposure in intubating real
   patients was limited among HO due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The training
   of HO,for RSI in ED needs to be further improvised to optimize their
   learning process.

AB INTRODUCTION Extensive regulations have been introduced to reduce
   secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among non-smokers in Malaysia. However,
   there is still a need to encourage behavior change of smokers in
   relation to making homes smokefree. This feasibility study aimed to use
   low-cost air pollution monitors to quantify SHS concentrations in
   Malaysian households and to explore the practicality of using
   personalized feedback in educating families to make their homes
   smoke-free.
   METHODS A total of 35 smokers in three states in Malaysia were recruited
   via snowball and convenience sampling methods. Indoor fine particulate
   (PM2.5) concentrations in participants' homes were measured for 7 days
   before and after educational intervention using a pre-defined template,
   which included personalized air-quality feedback, and information on SHS
   impacts were given. The feedback was delivered over two 20-minute phone
   calls or in-person sessions following the completion of the air-quality
   measurements. Data were corrected for outdoor PM2.5 concentrations from
   the nearest environmental monitor.
   RESULTS Despite the challenges in conducting the project during COVID-19
   pandemic, the delivery of the intervention was found to be feasible.
   Twenty-seven (77%) out of 35 participants completed PM2.5 measurements
   and received a complete intervention. The median (IQR: 25th -75th
   percentile concentrations) SHS-PM2.5 concentrations at baseline and
   follow-up were 18.3 mu g/m(3) (IQR: 13.3-28.3) and 16.2 mu g/m(3) (IQR:
   10.4 - 25.6), respectively. There was a reduction of SHS-PM2.5
   concentrations at follow-up measurement in the houses of 17 participants
   (63%). The change in corrected indoor PM2.5 concentrations between
   baseline and followup was not statistically significant (Z= -1.01,
   p=0.29).
   CONCLUSIONS This educational intervention, combining the use of a
   low-cost air particle counter with personalized air-quality feedback,
   was found to be feasible in the Malaysian setting. It has potential to
   trigger behavior change among smokers, reducing indoor smoking and
   consequent SHS concentrations, and increasing smoke-free home
   implementation. A large-scale trial is needed.

AB The HIV epidemic is fueled by poverty; yet, methods to measure poverty
   remain scarce among populations at risk for HIV infection and disease
   progression to AIDS in Malaysia. Between August and November 2020, using
   data from a cross-sectional study of people who use drugs, (PWUD),
   transgender people, sex workers and men who have sex with men, this
   study examined the reliability and validity of a material security scale
   as a measurement of poverty. Additionally, we assessed factors
   associated with material security scores. We performed confirmatory
   factor analysis (CFA) for 268 study participants included in the
   analysis. A revised nine-item three-factor structure of the material
   security scale demonstrated an excellent fit in CFA. The revised
   material security score displayed good reliability, with Cronbach's
   alpha of 0.843, 0.826 and 0.818 for housing, economic resources and
   basic needs factors, respectively. In a subsequent analysis, PWUD and
   transgender people were less likely to present good material security
   scores during the pandemic, compared to their counterparts. The revised
   nine-item scale is a useful tool to assess poverty among key populations
   at-risk for HIV/AIDS with the potential to be extrapolated in similar
   income settings.
